Churkin died on Feb. 20. And the United States Mission to the United Nations said, through a spokesman, that it was “not in a position to comment or to provide any details on the autopsy consistent with our obligations under the Headquarters Agreement between the United States and the United Nations.”  In fact, it is not unusual for the United States, as the host country, to leave it to a diplomat’s home country to announce a cause of death. That was the case when a Nigerian diplomat died in 2015 in Washington, for instance.  Mr. Churkin died suddenly after collapsing in the Russian mission on the East Side of Manhattan. The police at the time said they did not suspect foul play, noting that he suffered from heart ailments. The medical examiner’s office carried out an autopsy, which is standard procedure. The medical examiner’s reference to “diplomatic immunity” raised an additional question: How could a dead man could enjoy any immunity at all?  In fact, diplomatic immunity and privileges would apply to Mr. Churkin’s immediate family members “for a reasonable period of time,” according to the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. A spokesman for the Russian mission commended the decision to not release the autopsy results, saying that it “fully meets the inviolability of private life and diplomatic immunity.”","source":"nytamericas","date":"Fri, 10 Mar 2017 22:08:37 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"New York Examiner Won’t Disclose Cause of Russian Envoy’s Death","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/world/americas/vitaly-churkin-united-nations.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-03-10T22:58:30.472Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"58c32f9892119f14e72924f1"},"content":"OTTAWA — A judge who became known throughout Canada for asking a complainant why she could not just keep her “knees together” during a sexual assault has resigned from the country’s Federal Court. It was the latest in a series of episodes that have prompted questions about the handling of sexual assault cases in Canada.  The resignation of the judge, Justice Robin Camp, on Thursday was a rare event in Canada’s judicial system and followed the release of an unusually strongly worded report from the Canadian Judicial Council recommending his firing.  “The judge’s misconduct was manifestly serious and reflected a sustained pattern of beliefs of a particularly deplorable kind,” the council wrote in its report.  The release of that finding and Justice Camp’s resignation followed an announcement by prosecutors on Tuesday that they would appeal the acquittal of a former taxi driver in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in another sexual assault case. The provincial court judge in that case concluded that the complainant — who was found drunk, semi-naked and unconscious by the police in the back of a cab — had consented to sexual activity with the driver.  “Clearly, a drunk can consent,” Judge Gregory Lenehan had ruled.  A day later, prosecutors in St. John’s, Newfoundland, said that they would appeal the acquittal of a police officer who was charged with having sexually assaulted an intoxicated women who had asked for a ride home in his police cruiser.

We cannot perpetuate the belief that niceness cannot coexist with violence, evil or deviance, and consequently the nice guy must not be guilty of the alleged offense.”  The judge, Marvin Zuker of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Toronto, also took the unusual step of ordering the assailant, Mustafa Ururyar, who was sentenced to 18 months in prison, to pay Mandi Gray, the victim, 8,000 Canadian dollars to cover her lawyers’ fees. That will be challenged in the appeal.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.

Elizabeth Sheehy, a law professor at the University of Ottawa, said the highly publicized sexual assault trial of a former radio host and musician had led to increased public awareness of how courts handle such cases in Canada.

The council found that he repeatedly referred to the complainant, 19, as “the accused” while frequently suggesting that she had not been vigorous or creative enough in her attempts to stop the assault. Justice Camp also, the council’s report concluded, expressed his personal disagreement with federal laws concerning sexual assault and the treatment of vulnerable witnesses.  Justice Camp told the complainant during the trial that “some sex and pain sometimes go together,” adding “that’s not necessarily a bad thing.”  In arguing to keep his job, Justice Camp said that his remarks were the product of ignorance, not bias, and that he had since undergone training. His resignation from the Federal Court, which does not hear criminal cases including sexual assaults, took effect on Friday.

Kelly, the American homeland security secretary, acknowledged on Friday that President Trump’s executive orders on immigration and the perception that the United States was now inhospitable toward Muslims may be causing more migrants to seek refuge in Canada.  The growing number of refugee claimants who are entering Canada by illegally crossing from the United States was among the issues Mr. Kelly discussed with members of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s cabinet during a one-day visit to Ottawa.  Under an agreement between the countries, people who attempt to make a refugee claim in Canada by legally entering from the United States are turned away. A loophole, however, allows people who enter Canada illegally — or, as some prefer, irregularly — to claim they are refugees. In most cases, they receive a hearing to assess their case.  Mr. Kelly said that about 2,000 people had recently made such crossings and that they generally seemed to have been people who had legal immigration status in the United States.  During an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Mr. Kelly said that both countries were still “trying to get our arms around” the situation and its causes. When asked by the interviewer if it was the product of the executive orders as well as the perception that Muslims were no longer welcome in the United States, Mr. Kelly said: “It could be, I think you could draw that conclusion. I’m undecided.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  He added: “It’s something I don’t quite understand, but it could be.”  But speaking earlier in the day with reporters, Ralph Goodale, Canada’s public safety minister, who hosted Mr. Kelly’s visit, suggested that the crossings were not related to any actions by Mr. Trump.  “One thing that is clear from at least some of the data is that the migration began — or at least the planning for the migration — began many months ago,” Mr. Goodale said, without offering any details and suggesting that the situation started almost a year ago.  When asked what Canada wanted the United States to do about the crossings, Mr. Goodale suggested that American officials were largely powerless. Noting that most of the migrants apparently had legal status in the United States, Mr. Goodale said there was no way to track or restrain their travel within the country.

Some of the people turned back have said they were questioned about their religious views or opinions about Mr. Trump.

He was brought down by his behavior as a provincial court judge in Alberta during a 2014 trial. Among other things, he asked the complainant in that case why she hadn’t just kept her “knees together.” And separately, prosecutors in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and St. John’s, Newfoundland, said they would appeal cases in which young women said they had been attacked while drunk. Those attacks took place in a taxi and a police car. And next week, the conviction in a highly publicized Toronto case will be appealed.

The often fractious talks that created the agreement took over my reporting life for a couple of years. While articles in Canada focused on Simon Reisman, Canada’s sometimes bombastic chief negotiator, Clayton Yeutter, the United States’ top trade official, was also no wallflower in my experience. Mr. Yeutter died last week at the age of 86. In an obituary, Daniel E. Slotnik reported that The Times once aptly described Mr. Yeutter as “a burly, back-thumping, 58-year-old official with the voice of a hog caller.”  Harm Reduction The Times’s Daily 360 video group visited safe drug-injection sites in Vancouver, British Columbia, and posted its results this week.

Ms. Vieira feared he would stop breathing, but couldn’t get to a hospital with doctors on duty from her downtrodden neighborhood at that late hour, when rats scurry on the rutted roads but no buses were running.

Gazing into a mirror, she snapped a selfie. “Look at me!” she crowed.  Photo  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The respite was short-lived. That afternoon, Daniel’s medicine ran out and Ms. Vieira had no money for more.  Daniel’s very conception defied the odds. Ms. Vieira developed uterine cancer when her other child was a toddler. She had resisted doctors’ advice to have her uterus removed, even though they said her chances of having another child were slim.

They rushed marriage so their church wouldn’t learn of their premarital sex.  A month after the wedding, she learned she was three months pregnant. “It was the biggest joy of my life,” she said. Her husband was excited, too. “We wanted to have our child,” he said.

Daniel cried so inconsolably that “I thought my life would end,” Ms. Vieira said. Mr. de Oliveira said his wife would not ask him for help and admitted he was too angry at her to offer. “My problem was direct with her and not with the baby,” he said.  At two months, Daniel awoke laboring for breath.

He retaliated, posting a video insulting her. She began dating and told him, “You are not going to see your son,” he said. After technical disputes about child support, he stopped paying.

In this achingly poor section of the Brazilian city of Recife, where a water channel has become an acrid open sewer, and clusters of men stand around smoking marijuana while young girls sniff glue from soda bottles, the couple is struggling to raise a baby with disabilities caused by the Zika virus.  Their daughter, Eduarda Vitória, now 17 months old, has a range of problems stemming from brain damage caused by Zika, which her mother contracted when she was bitten by an infected mosquito while pregnant.  When Eduarda was born, her parents had never heard of Zika, and they said doctors at the hospital did not understand it. But they knew something was wrong. In the hospital nursery, Mr. de Araújo said, “I kept looking at her big body and very small head.”  The small head, a condition called microcephaly, was the most obvious sign of Zika damage. But Eduarda also suffers from seizures, muscle problems, impaired vision, and problems eating. She cries unless she is held, usually calmed only when her father kisses her belly or her mother plays religious songs on her cellphone and sings along.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Poverty makes it hard for the family to manage Eduarda’s needs. Both parents are unemployed and receive a monthly government check of 880 reais (less than $300).  Ms. dos Santos, 21, was abused by a stepmother, ran away to live on the streets at age 8, and became a crack user and prostitute until Mr. de Araújo, 48, met her. She has a stab wound on her left arm from a fight with a client over drugs and has struggled to stay clean since her first child, two-year-old Vitória Maria, was born.

Her parents protect Eduarda’s seizure medicine from rodents by keeping it in a plastic bag tied to a pipe.

The ebullience in the stands — and the intensity and joy of the play on the field — does not match the calendar. We don’t often see that kind of baseball here, and it is a treat.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  On Saturday, the fans rattled an American pitcher, Tanner Roark, who struggled to stay composed as the Dominicans rallied from a five-run deficit. On Sunday, the Dominican shortstop Jean Segura said the fans almost intimidated him — and they were on his side.  “I’m not going to lie to you guys, it made me nervous to see that many guys up from the Dominican,” Segura, the Seattle Mariners’ shortstop, said at a postgame news conference. “That’s unbelievable. I think we got the best fans in the world.”  The United States will join the Dominicans in San Diego, and try to advance to the finals for the first time in four World Baseball Classics. While most boldface United States starters passed on the event, those who came have so far been dominant: Chris Archer, Marcus Stroman and Danny Duffy have combined for 12 ⅔ shutout innings, allowing five hits and no walks with 14 strikeouts.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But the most important throw on Sunday came from the Dominican left fielder, Jose Bautista. Had he allowed Oscar Mercado to score with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, Colombia would have won and advanced to the second round. That very likely would have forced the Dominicans into an elimination tiebreaker game with the United States on Monday.

Bautista, the 36-year-old slugger for the Toronto Blue Jays, has not played left field in the majors since 2009. He usually plays in right, but he has improvised to fit into a packed Dominican lineup. With the score tied, 3-3, in the ninth, he was positioned exactly right for Reynaldo Rodriguez’s one-out fly ball.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Bautista caught it, and his location gave him options. He was so shallow, he said, that he could sacrifice power for accuracy on his throw. As long as he delivered a strike, he would count on catcher Welington Castillo, now a division foe with the Baltimore Orioles, to do the rest.  The throw was on target, but a bit slow to arrive. It bounced once, and Castillo reached into the baseline to scoop up the ball on a short hop. Mercado arrived just as he did, and Castillo held on tight. He said he never doubted that he had a firm grip.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “I was in good position,” he said. “The hardest part was the contact. I didn’t know if he’s going to roll on top of me or if he’s going to slide. You never know what the runner’s going to do.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Clutching the ball with his mitt and securing it briefly with his bare hand, Castillo tagged the lower leg of Mercado, who tried to slide by to his right but never did touch the plate. Castillo held the ball triumphantly for the umpire, then pumped his fist with it three times. He had saved the game.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Two innings later, he would win it. At the W.B.C., innings after the 10th begin with runners on first and second. Castillo was due up third in the 11th, and said he had quickly deduced what that meant: The leadoff man would bunt the runners to second and third, followed by an intentional walk. Castillo would be the first hitter with a chance to swing away off William Cuevas, and he drove a two-run single to left to break the tie.  Segura would soon double home three more, and a tight game became a rout. Segura, a late addition to the roster when a sore shoulder felled Hanley Ramirez, had three hits and called the game the highlight of his career.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  That is what Cruz said on Saturday night, after his go-ahead homer off Andrew Miller. These games, he said Sunday, would now be part of Dominican lore.  “Definitely, it’ll be like a legend; everybody will talk about it forever,” Cruz said, smiling. “I mean, the whole country knows about baseball. They’re experts about where to play in the lineup, who should bunt, stuff like that. Nothing new.”  Colombia went 1-2 in its W.B.C. debut, beating Canada, which was 0-3, and losing twice in extra innings. Just 20 players born in Colombia have reached the majors, compared with 669 from the Dominican Republic. Yet for one moment Sunday, as Mercado charged home before Castillo’s steady tag, the Colombians nearly prevailed.  “It hurts a lot, of course — we were 90 feet from surprising the world, from shocking the Dominicans,” said Luis Urueta, Colombia’s manager. Even in defeat, he added, it was a satisfying run: “We did not win, but we won a lot inside.”","source":"nytamericas","date":"Mon, 13 Mar 2017 03:02:56 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"On Baseball: Playing for Fans Who Travel, Dominicans Feel Right at Home","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/12/sports/baseball/dominicans-world-baseball-classic.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-03-13T03:18:31.176Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"58c66d4892119f07732924f0"},"content":"President Trump is far behind where experts in both parties, including some in his administration, say he should be in filling government vacancies.

They refer to it as an invasion because once the bison arrived, they thrived everywhere and began competing with the horses and mammoths that had grazed the Great Plains for millions of years.  “The only other invasion of North America that has had such an ecological and environmental impact has been us,” said Beth Shapiro, an evolutionary molecular biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a co-author of the paper, which appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  In the millenniums that followed, the ancient bison evolved into the iconic American buffalo we know today.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Dr. Shapiro worked with Duane Froese, an earth scientist from the University of Alberta in Canada and the lead author of the paper, to construct the chronology of the bison colonization.  One key to narrowing down when the bison arrived came from a serendipitous find made by Dr. Froese’s colleague Alberto Reyes, a geologist from the University of Alberta. In 2006 while studying ancient volcanic ash buried in the northern Yukon in northwestern Canada, Dr. Reyes stumbled across a bone jutting from the frozen mud near the ash layer.  Photo  He passed it off to Grant D. Zazula, the paleontologist on the site, and returned to his lab to write a paper on the history of permafrost. It was not until several years later while he was working on the paper that something jogged his memory.  “This light bulb went off as I was going through my old field notes,” Dr. Reyes said. “‘Oh my God, I forgot about this bone that I gave to that paleontologist. That bone could be pretty important.’”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  It was.  The fossil was of a bone from the front foot of a steppe bison, an extinct species that came from Siberia, believed to be 130,000 years old. That would make it the oldest bison fossil found on the continent. Dr. Reyes determined its age by using the ancient volcanic ash layer near where it was found, which has a known age, as a reference.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In addition to sequencing the mitochondrial DNA of the bone, the team also sequenced the mitochondrial genome of a 120,000-year-old fossil belonging to an extinct giant longhorn bison that was found in Snowmass Village, Colo., a ski resort town.  Thought to be the largest bison to have ever lived, the giant longhorn was about two tons and more than eight feet tall at the shoulders. It lived in what is now the southern part of Canada and in the contiguous United States.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  After sequencing both beasts’ DNAs, the team compared them with the genomes of about 40 other bison fossils from Siberia and North America. It found that the steppe and longhorn bison specimens were genetically very similar and that both were descendants from the first bison to come to North America, even though they looked very different and lived far apart.  Photo  The team’s genetic analysis suggests that after bison ancestors first invaded from Asia more than 130,000 years ago, when sea levels are thought to have been much lower, they dispersed throughout the continent within about 20,000 years, much quicker than previously thought. During that time their looks and body sizes changed as they adapted to their specific environments, rapidly giving rise to creatures like the giant longhorn.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “This revises everything we thought about how bison came into North America and evolved after that,” Dr. Shapiro said.  Hendrik Poinar, an evolutionary biologist from McMaster University in Ontario, who was not involved in the study, was impressed with how the team integrated paleontological, geological and genetic information into “a single narrative that is quite convincing.”  He added that “until more fossils come along, this will stand as the best estimate of the timing of bison into North America.”","source":"nytamericas","date":"Mon, 13 Mar 2017 22:50:40 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Trilobites: A Start Date for the Bison Invasion of North America","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/science/bison-buffalo-north-america.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-03-13T23:18:32.695Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"58c73b8992119f48422924ef"},"content":"Those “milestones” remain significant hurdles for the island’s government. But while the government works to meet them, it can now show creditors a board-certified document explaining how much cash is available to repay the large debt, and where the cash is going to come from.

And time was running out. Under a special federal law for insolvent United States territories, Puerto Rico has court protection from its creditors until May 1. Some have already tried to sue to recover their money.  The governor’s fiscal plan includes enough belt-tightening to cause an annual economic contraction of 2 to 3 percent — a bite that residents of the island will almost certainly resent. But that is nothing like the 17 percent economic contraction the board had warned about earlier this year, in a document describing a worst-case scenario.  To get the board’s provisional approval, Mr. Rosselló said he had to find ways to come up with $160 million more in government revenue than he had in a previous version of the plan, which was rejected by the board Thursday. The oversight board warned him then that his original version was “unrealistic,” leading to marathon discussions over the weekend.

But the governor remained unwilling to bend in three contentious areas: how much to cut pensions for retired government workers; whether to constrain the current public work force to two- and four-day workweeks to save money; and whether to stop paying all public workers a Christmas bonus, in light of the fact that bondholders are not being paid.

Mr. Rosselló had especially opposed any furlough, saying it would hurt the economy too much.  “A reduction of 30 percent of the work force represents 45,000 people in Puerto Rico,” he said. Reducing the work force by that much could cause a 9 percent economic contraction, he said.

If the measures are not considered effective enough by October, the board will consider carrying out some type of furlough.

In addition, it calls for newly hired public workers to be enrolled in Social Security, and for current public workers younger than 40 to enroll “to the extent practicable.”  The board was established by an act of Congress last year to guide Puerto Rico through a restructuring of its more than $70 billion of debt. Puerto Rico amassed the debt by borrowing year after year to give the appearance of having balanced its budget.  Before any restructuring can start, Puerto Rico was legally required to produce a credible plan for bringing its budget back into balance. Mr. Rosselló’s government had already requested the maximum allowable time extensions, and if no credible plan had been submitted by Saturday, the board was required to impose one.","source":"nytamericas","date":"Mon, 13 Mar 2017 23:55:11 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Puerto Rico, Mired in Debt, Has a New Rescue Plan","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/business/puerto-rico-debt-crisis-oversight-board.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-03-14T00:38:33.428Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"58c865517ae3a80fd532ae22"},"content":"Relações familiares foram destruídas e meios de subsistência, antes precários, foram devastados.

The surprise pairing at the new musical “Come From Away” was rich with symbolism, as Mr. Trudeau tries to maintain his country’s close relationship with the United States despite substantial differences in public policy. Ms. Trump, the president’s daughter and a close adviser, sat in Row F between Mr. Trudeau and Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, and directly behind a former Canadian prime minister, Jean Chrétien.  In brief remarks from the stage before the performance, Mr. Trudeau did not discuss government policy explicitly. Instead he focused on praising the show’s story, about a small town in Newfoundland that fed and housed thousands of air travelers from around the world, diverted when North American airspace was closed during the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.  Photo  “The world gets to see what it is to lean on each other and be there for each other through the darkest times,” he said.  Mr. Trudeau, who was seeing the musical for the first time, said he also saw it as a demonstration of the importance of close relations between Canada and the United States.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “There is no relationship quite like the friendship between Canada and the United States,” he said. “This story, this amazing show, is very much about that, and it’s about friendship as well.”  Mr. Trudeau’s celebration of a show about Canadians opening their borders and homes to foreigners in need comes at a complex moment for his country’s relationship with its southern neighbor. Beyond the Trump administration’s demands for reworking the North American Free Trade Agreement, its ban on immigrants from six predominantly Muslim countries, blocked on Wednesday by a federal judge, has set off a surge in asylum seekers fleeing from the United States to Canada, where they have largely been welcomed.  Mr. Trudeau, who was greeted at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater with a sustained standing ovation, led a delegation of 600 people — including more than 125 ambassadors to the United Nations — brought to the show on Wednesday by the Canadian consulate general in New York. The audience was filled with exuberant Canadians, some bearing flags or wearing clothing decorated with the maple leaf.  Photo  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “Come From Away” is written by a married Canadian couple, Irene Sankoff and David Hein, and tells a distinctly Canadian story. The show also depicts the shame that Muslim air travelers feel at being singled out for scrutiny; cheers the welcome given a gay couple in Newfoundland; and features a black passenger worried about being mistaken for a thief and being shot — all issues that have deep resonance during the Trump era, with critics of the new administration skeptical of the president’s understanding of those concerns.  The show opened on March 12 and received a positive review in The New York Times. The critic Ben Brantley called it a “big bearhug of a musical.”  The show had several pre-Broadway productions, including one in Toronto from November 2016 through January 2017, and is scheduled to open another production in Toronto next February.

The woman was wearing a wide-brimmed felt halt and carried a vintage leather handbag; the man sported tousled curls, forearm tattoos and skinny jeans. There was nothing remarkable about this scene — stylish 20-somethings ordering gourmet sandwiches in a self-consciously rustic space — except that it unfolded in a destination that has seemed immune to hipsterdom.  Photo  Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, is almost invariably described as old-fashioned, nostalgia-tinged and slow-paced. But in the past few years, an energetic cadre of entrepreneurs with social media proficiency and a keen awareness of global trends has begun to breathe fresh life into this traditionally sleepy South American city. Most are design and trend-savvy millennials who are opening up restaurants and boutiques, organizing street festivals and supper clubs, and daring to stand out in a society that has typically rewarded modesty.  “Thanks in part to social media, young Uruguayans have a global mind-set and are very motivated,” said Mónica Zanocchi, the founder of a popular fashion and lifestyle blog called Couture. “There are a lot of creative professionals entering the work force, and since established companies can’t absorb all of this new talent, they end up becoming entrepreneurs.”  Photo  Futuro Refuerzos is led by Fermín Solana, a food writer and rock musician who grew frustrated with the lack of options in Montevideo. “There was nowhere to eat a decent sandwich beyond the old places that make chivitos,” he said, referring to the traditional steak sandwiches that are offered in neighborhood joints or local fast-food chains. “I looked at Santiago and Lima, where the sandwiches are incredible, and decided to take a risk.” Soon after opening in late 2015, Futuro Refuerzos had garnered a following thanks to creations like “gol,” handmade pita filled with spiced meatballs, sweet blood sausage and red cabbage.  Mr. Solana is part of a group of young restaurateurs and chefs fueling the city’s small but growing foodie circuit, which right now includes over a dozen restaurants, cafes and specialty stores (until recently, Montevidean epicures spoke of living in a culinary wasteland, so this is a noticeable improvement).  Photo  There is Estrecho, a tiny restaurant in the historic district with simple décor belying a sophisticated lunchtime menu prepared by Cali Diemarch, a chef trained in the United States who invents his daily dishes on the fly, such as a deconstructed chivito made with filet mignon, poached egg, caramelized pancetta and fried onions. La Pasionaria, a concept store and restaurant on a quiet nearby street, recently welcomed a new young chef, Luciana Fia, who makes pasta, ice cream and other food by hand, using fresh, local ingredients.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  At Sucré Salé Bistro, a casual spot near downtown, on the back patio of the Alliance Française de Montevideo, Florencia Ibarra often sneaks refined dishes like rabbit in mustard sauce with boulangère potatoes into her unfussy Gallic-influenced menu. Leading the pack is the retro-chic and market-driven Jacinto, headed by Lucía Soria, an alumna of the famed Argentine chef Francis Mallmann. Ms. Soria frequently appears on television, participates in food festivals like Degusto and headlines as the top guest chef in supper clubs like Mesabrava.  Photo  “Finally, we have good places to eat, good live music and a generation of people who are breaking away from the old molds,” Mr. Solana said. “I think the city’s lighting up.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Montevideo’s new vibe is closely linked to fashion and interior design, as seen in a surge of shops selling locally made clothes, accessories and home accents. Last year, one of the most dynamic new labels, Rotunda, unveiled a sleek multistory boutique in the Punta Carretas neighborhood, complete with its own photography studio, where the owners, Kevin Jakter and Sofía Dominguez, showcase their expanding line of minimalist women’s clothing, eyewear, shoes, and jewelry.  Photo  Ten blocks away in the residential and commercial district of Pocitos, a trendy multibrand store, Tienda, sells start-up labels like Pastiche, which specializes in high-end denim, and Mutma, a maker of leather shoes and handbags. Casa Baném, a home décor store set in a colonial-style villa in upscale Carraco, also stocks a variety of homegrown brands like Don Baez, known for its throws and pillows made with Uruguayan merino wool, and Home Touch, which makes vintage-style lighting.  This design boom can be gauged at MoWeek, the local fashion week held in April and October, which began in 2010 with six showrooms and now includes more than 60. “They’re all independent brands started by a new generation, which is impressive,” Ms. Zanocchi of Couture said. “Montevideo is still quiet, but there are some very interesting alternative scenes that are seeping into the mainstream.”","source":"nytamericas","date":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 04:01:25 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Heads Up: Millennial Entrepreneurs Give Sleepy Montevideo a Fresh Jolt","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/travel/montevideo-uruguay-millennial-entrepreneurs-design-fashion-restaurants.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-03-16T04:48:24.995Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"58ca56087ae3a84a1132ae19"},"content":"Beyond that, the bill, which has not yet been approved by Congress, flips the very premise of modern justice on its head: Rather than innocent before proved guilty, it would require concrete evidence of reasonable doubt, essentially shifting the burden of proof to the accused.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “It is not only a counter reform, but it has reforms that contravene the right to a proper defense,” said Alejandra Ramos, a judge in the state of Chihuahua. “They want to pass this because it is easier to do than to train police officers and prosecutors, clean up the entire system and break the use of torture as the main tool of investigation.”  The legislation reflects a central contradiction of modern Mexico under Mr. Peña Nieto and his party: the version of the country that his government promotes to the world versus the reality it creates on the ground.  In promoting Brand Mexico, the government has fashioned the image of an ascending nation, a regional leader ready to take its place on the global stage, competitive on issues of trade, economics and culture. And yet, presented with mounting violence, vast inequality and a human rights crisis in which torture at the hands of security forces is “generalized,” in the words of the United Nations, the same government frequently runs roughshod over the rights it claims to defend.  Photo  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The government’s recent scolding of the Trump administration — while actively trying to roll back the rights of Mexicans at home — underscores the paradox.  When Mr. Trump ordered a wall between the two nations, the Mexicans called it an alarming assault on their dignity, vowing to defend their citizens in the United States and publicly insisting last month that “all Mexicans should be treated with absolute respect to their civil rights and human rights.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But back home, the Mexican government was busy doing the opposite, introducing a bill to reverse central tenets of the new justice system with such little publicity that many lawmakers, judges and defense lawyers do not even know about it.  International bodies that oversee Mexico’s human rights record say the legislation is part of a long pattern by the government. In its handling of the vast corruption that runs through the justice and political systems, the impunity of its security forces, or the investigations into the tens of thousands of disappearances across the country, they say, the government often undermines the major breakthroughs it claims to be making.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “Mexico has worked hard to promote its image as a state that defends or advances international human rights,” said James Cavallaro, a commissioner on the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and a professor at Stanford Law School. “But at home, the human rights situation is simply dreadful: severe abuse, torture, summary executions and virtually guaranteed impunity.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The bill is part of a broader packet of changes. The governing party and other lawmakers have also submitted several versions of the law that would legalize the army’s enforcement of domestic security, a role the military has played without a legal mandate since the drug war began a decade ago.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  During that time, torture and extrajudicial killings have soared. According to the government’s own data, the military kills far more combatants than it injures, a lopsided record that defies the history of war. The elite marine forces, for instance, kill 30 people for every person they injure, a ratio that experts say points to a high likelihood of extrajudicial killings.  Very few soldiers are ever punished for crossing the line. Of the roughly 4,000 complaints of torture that the attorney general’s office has reviewed since 2006, only 15 have resulted in convictions, raising broad international concerns about impunity and the government’s willingness to tackle human rights abuses.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The government says the military bill will help regulate the armed forces, giving them the legal authority to continue their essential role in fighting organized crime.  Photo  “But that isn’t the right question,” said Jan Jarab, the representative for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Mexico. “The right question is, Should they continue to do it at all? The right question is, Has the military paradigm been successful? The answer to that, in a huge and overwhelming majority, is no.”  Driving the government’s legislative push is a profound fear: that the nation’s fragile security situation, already a major stain on Mexico’s international image, could unravel further.  The new legal system, for example, retooled with the United States over a period of eight years, affords more protections for defendants and requires robust evidence to detain people. As a result, Mexican officials say, suspects are walking free, to the frustration of prosecutors, the police and even regular citizens.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “Like all recently implemented systems, it is necessary to make certain adjustments for it to work as it should,” the president’s office said in a statement explaining the proposed changes. “Different sectors of the new justice system and civil society groups have expressed the need to make adjustments.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The government added that it was fully committed to human rights, had pressed forward vigorously to enact the legal system and had “trained all of the police in the country” in the new legal standards.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But under the government’s proposals, critics say, longstanding efforts to tighten rules on evidence and train a functioning police force would most likely be abandoned for a more expedient approach to dealing with crime, leaving untouched a central problem plaguing Mexico today: impunity.  “If you look at both of these laws, they are geared towards the same goal — the police having more power and slowly transitioning the country into something like a police state,” said Javier Carrasco, the executive director of the Institute of Penal Justice. “They are both geared towards the same horizon.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The United States has been notably quiet about the bills, given how much it has invested to overhaul Mexico’s legal system. The Americans have equipped courtrooms across the country and trained judges, prosecutors, police officers and law professors.  To some critics, the United States’ silence is a reflection of the new relationship between the two countries, with American influence waning amid the hostilities between Mr. Trump and Mexico.  Photo  “We have lost our ability to have a dialogue with them now,” said Mark Feierstein, the former director of Western Hemisphere affairs at the National Security Council under President Barack Obama. “With the Trump administration’s attitude towards our press and judicial system, and the coarse language he uses, we have lost our standing globally.”  When the legal reform was first passed in 2008, it was hailed across Mexico’s political spectrum as a seminal moment for the country. No longer would court decisions remain shielded under an opaque written system. Instead, the entire country would move to a so-called accusatorial system, in which prosecutors and defense lawyers presented their evidence in public.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But the new criminal justice system has exposed deep flaws in the capacity of law enforcement to collect evidence and investigate cases. Despite eight years of training, the authorities still often rely on a single confession obtained through torture, and some officials have condemned the higher burden of proof, especially when suspects are released because of it.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story  For all of the criticism of the military, there is widespread agreement in Mexico that no other institution is ready to battle organized crime. Sending soldiers back to their barracks could create a security vacuum, a point leaders of the army have repeatedly made when demanding legal protections.  Mr. Peña Nieto, whose approval ratings are the lowest of any president in a quarter century, has been supportive of both measures.  In 2014, one of his allies submitted a similar package of changes to the new legal system. Then, as now, the effort came at a time of national tension and distraction, just two months after the mysterious disappearance of 43 students. Opponents fought the changes and prevented their passage.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Then, in December, during a session with his National Security Council, Mr. Peña Nieto urged lawmakers to broaden the military’s power in domestic affairs and promised that in 2017 his administration would work on “correcting the operational flaws of the new penal justice system.”  To gain support for the bills, Mr. Peña Nieto has relied on a strategic ally, César Camacho, the leader of his party in Congress who submitted them. Mr. Camacho, a longtime politician, is in a unique position: He was a principal shepherd of the new legal system that was hailed as a breakthrough for Mexico. But he has been conspicuously quiet about his legal reform bill, even when publicly discussing the problems it is supposed to be solving.  Photo  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  On a recent panel in Mexico City, Mr. Camacho shared the dais with several legal experts invited to assess the “New System of Justice: What Is Lacking for Its Consolidation?”  For more than two hours, the panelists talked about the legal system, discussing the need to ensure that prosecutors and police officers are better trained. Not a single person, including Mr. Camacho, mentioned his bill to reverse significant elements of the system, a reflection of the lawmaker’s power and the reluctance of many to challenge him.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  After the discussion, when asked about his bill in an interview, Mr. Camacho shook his head and smiled.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “I am a proponent of the accusatory system, and I know it inside out,” he said. “What is necessary now is to make adjustments that allow for an absolute respect to civil liberties, and to give the Mexican state instruments and elements to make it more efficient.”  Mr. Camacho has been more outspoken about the military bill, tamping down opposition in January by saying that it would ultimately benefit human rights.  “This law is not intended to militarize the country,” he said during a radio interview, “but rather to give certainty to the population so we know the boundaries of the armed forces’ actions.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But rather than curtailing the scope of the military’s operations, Mr. Camacho’s bill would expand its official powers to include police functions like executing arrest warrants, tapping private communications, overseeing crime scenes, interviewing witnesses and investigating cases.  Mr. Camacho has told officials that while the legislation carries his name, its true authors are the arms of law enforcement in the country: the attorney general’s office, the National Security Council and the military.  The decision to install the military on the front lines with drug traffickers was, from the beginning, a tacit admission that the police could not manage the fight. With the police picked apart by corruption, poor training and disorganization, the army was the only force left capable of confronting the growing power and violence of the cartels.  Photo  But a decade’s worth of research has shown that deploying the army has only deepened the country’s crisis. Beyond human rights violations, many argue that the strategy has been a failure from a security standpoint alone. Violence in Mexico today is once again approaching the peak levels of the drug war reached six years ago.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  New research has also shown that when the army is deployed in a community, violence tends to rise. Homicide rates increased 8 percent in areas where the military deployed, and 9 percent where the navy was active, according to research published by CIDE, a Mexican research center.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “We have been through the same strategy of militarizing public safety, and it has been a tremendous failure,” said Catalina Perez-Correa, a professor at CIDE who has studied the issue. “Not only has it not diminished violence, we now have evidence that it has worsened violence in Mexico.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Justice has always been a moving target in Mexico, where 98 percent of homicides go unsolved. But most legal scholars say the new legal system is infinitely better than the one it replaced. Still, its execution, they warn, relies on civil servants with poor training and, in some cases, bad habits.  “We have not done what was necessary to make the system function properly,” José Ramón Cossío Díaz, a Supreme Court justice, said in an interview with the newspaper Universal. “I think a lot of people are assuming that just because we have oral trials and courtrooms, because we have the scenery, that the trials will work, but this is not a play.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The state of Chihuahua, along the border with Texas, was the first to undergo the transition in 2008, and the first to pass legislation to essentially reverse it after an outcry from law enforcement officials in 2010 and 2011.  “A reform of this size and relevance requires a complex transition process, a cultural change of mind, a generational turnover even,” said Pablo Gonzalez, a judge in Chihuahua. “But that doesn’t mean we should stop walking the path towards that goal, no matter how complex and how much time it takes us to get there.”  Fundamentally, he said, it boils down to a choice between controlling crime with arbitrary arrests or delivering something closer to justice.  “We cannot play the same game on the federal level,” he said. “We cannot make that bet, because there is simply too much at stake.”","source":"nytamericas","date":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 09:00:41 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"While Scolding Trump, Mexico Seeks to Curtail Citizens’ Rights","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/world/americas/mexico-trump-pena-nieto-wall-drug-war.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-03-16T09:08:24.890Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"58ca64187ae3a8607532ae17"},"content":"The president’s proposal represents an “America First” budget that, in one reporter’s analysis, makes parts of America more first than others.

The executives are still cautious, but they say they are more hopeful compared with past years.  Renato Ejnisman, the managing director of Banco Bradesco BBI, the investment bank arm of Banco Bradesco, said more than 10 companies were considering stock offerings this year. Moreover, they come from diverse sectors including consumer, infrastructure and utilities.  “We have not had such a level of activity in the last four years,” Mr. Ejnisman said.  Others share that sentiment. Roderick Greenlees, global head of investment banking at Itaú BBA, estimated that 10 to 15 I.P.O.s could be held in Brazil this year.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  If that prediction were to come true, the number of offerings this year would dwarf that of the previous three years, when there was only one I.P.O. a year. It would be on par with 2010 and 2011, which each had 11 I.P.O.s. Since 2010, the best year was 2013, which had 13. The deal activity is not off the charts, however. “We’re still in a selective market,” Mr. Ejnisman said.  The thaw is partly because of investors’ pent-up demand after a period of economic downturn. “The market has been starving for equity for so long,” said Patricia Moraes, the head of banking in Brazil for JPMorgan, who, like the other bankers quoted in this article, would speak only about the state of the market and not about any specific I.P.O.

The combination of the country’s worst economic recession in decades and a huge corruption scandal created conditions for the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff in 2016, even though she was not accused of personal enrichment, unlike many of the politicians who led the effort to oust her. Brazil’s Senate convicted her of violating budgetary laws.  The impeachment remains controversial, the motives dubious, and President Michel Temer, who took over for Ms. Rousseff after helping engineer her fall, is highly unpopular. Yet the finance sector credits his government with some changes.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Inflation has fallen, and Brazil’s currency has gained value relative to others. The Central Bank lowered its benchmark interest rate multiple times over the past several months.

In January and February, JPMorgan was involved in four equity offerings in Latin America, two of them in Brazil. In those, it raised $2.7 billion with over $12 billion in demand, Ms. Moraes said.  That amount alone is already 26 percent of the $10.4 billion raised in all equity offerings in Latin America in 2016, according to Dealogic.

In addition to Morgan Stanley, the company recently hired Credit Suisse, Bradesco BBI, Itaú BBA, JPMorgan and UBS.    Edemir Pinto, president of BM\u0026FBovespa, said in February that by the end of the year, he expected about 17 companies to raise approximately 25 billion reais (about $8.1 billion) in equity offerings on the São Paulo exchange.  Uncertainty still looms, however, accounting for the cautious optimism.  While the São Paulo bourse surged last year, the real economy has still lagged far behind. Most growth estimates for this year are under 1 percent. Banco Safra’s head economist, Carlos Kawall, forecasts 0 percent.  Brazil’s most recent unemployment rate, measured over a three-month period ending in January, rose to 12.6 percent, up from 9.5 percent one year ago. Real wages continue to fall.

Until some of these uncertainties are resolved, investors might be wary of overexposing themselves to the Brazilian market.

Ms. Moraes of JPMorgan said one of her biggest concerns was “the political volatility in Brazil, which could delay investment decisions by companies and investors.”  Still, she and others said recent developments offered reasons to be hopeful, in particular the return of foreign investors to recent stock offerings.  “Now it’s a more balanced demand,” said Mr. Greenlees of Itaú BBA. “We’ve seen some respectable foreign investors that were not in the market last year come back.”","source":"nytamericas","date":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 18:12:50 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Cautious Optimism in Brazil as Appetite Returns for I.P.O.s","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/business/dealbook/brazil-technology-ipo-sao-paulo.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-03-16T18:28:24.873Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"58cb118a7ae3a8767c32ae18"},"content":"Here are the winners and losers in the budget, broken down by agency.  _____  Photo  2.

Photo  Although the musical has been in development for years, it arrives on Broadway at a complex moment for Canada’s relationship with its southern neighbor. The Trump administration is demanding to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement — a pact strongly supported by Mr. Trudeau; the United States ban on immigrants from six predominantly Muslim countries, blocked on Wednesday by a federal judge, has set off a surge in asylum seekers fleeing from the United States to Canada, where they have largely been welcomed; and Mr. Trump’s budget proposal would eliminate a federal program aimed at cleaning up the Great Lakes, which over 10 million Canadians rely on for their drinking water.

Then, pressed by Tom Brokaw of NBC on differences about refugees, he said, “I know — and I’ve always felt, for Canada — that we recognize that diversity is a great source of strength, and that’s something we’re open to in the world.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Canadians in the audience were more explicit in seeing the show as a moment to highlight how Canada’s welcoming of refugees contrasts with America’s harsher policy.  “Canada understands these people are just looking for security and a safe place for their families,’’ said Sophie de Caen, 57, who moved to New York from Montreal, where she works for the United Nations Development Program, which helps Syrian refugees, among others. “As we can see in this show, Canadians have a generosity of spirit.

Photo  The musical is by Irene Sankoff and David Hein, and was nurtured by the Canadian Music Theater Project at Sheridan College near Toronto. But most of its pre-Broadway development took place in the United States, and the vast majority of the show’s $12 million capitalization was raised here, though there are a number of Canadian investors.

The show had one pre-Broadway run in Canada, an eight-week stand at the Royal Alexandra Theater in Toronto, where standing-room space and an extra performance were added to meet demand, and the show is returning to the same theater next year (this will be in addition to the Broadway production, assuming it’s still running).

The White House’s 2018 budget proposal would, if approved by Congress, gut the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a federal program that has helped to remove water pollution and harmful algae on both sides of the border. The issue could become one more point of friction between the United States and Canada, already divided over trade and immigration.  The budget proposal, which reflects President Trump’s wish to drastically reduce the size and scope of the Environmental Protection Agency, has dismayed the Canadian government, which cooperates with the United States to clean up and protect the Great Lakes. The lakes are the source of drinking water for 45 million people — including 10 million in Ontario, about 90 percent of its population. Ontario has the largest shoreline on the Great Lakes of any jurisdiction in Canada and the United States.  “Canada has a long history of working collaboratively with the U.S. and invests significant resources in restoring and protecting the Great Lakes,” Catherine McKenna, Canada’s environment and climate change minister, said on Thursday. “We have done so to protect the health and economies of communities around the Great Lakes. We must now pursue that commitment to keep protecting this precious resource.”  Ms. McKenna was in Washington on Thursday to press her American counterparts to maintain United States funding for the program, about $300 million annually. Since it was established in 2009 by President Barack Obama, over $2.2 billion has gone to fund more than 2,000 projects across eight states. The projects have been aimed at removing toxic waste, restoring wildlife habitats and girding against invasive species such as the Asian Carp in the vast freshwater bodies, which hold one-fifth of the world’s fresh surface water. Canada contributes over $13 million in annual funding for Great Lakes restoration, government officials said.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Although the budget cuts would target projects in the United States, Canadian towns and cities that rely on the lake system would also be affected, advocates say. These include five binational Areas of Concern, like the Detroit River, a long-polluted waterway between Ontario and Michigan, as well as nutrient management projects in Lake Erie that focus on preventing algae blooms triggered by industrial contaminants.  Since word of the proposed cuts to the program leaked earlier this month, dozens of Canadian mayors and other officials have spoken out about the harm their cities and towns would suffer if the proposal were to go into effect.

Despite marked progress in cleaning up the river and surrounding habitats, the city remains designated as an Area of Concern by the Canadian government.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Residents and politicians on both sides of the border say they are mystified by the proposed budget cuts, which they say would do massive damage to waters still reeling from decades of industrial contamination.  A large amount of the program’s funding has in past years gone toward preventing toxic algae blooms, like one in 2014 that forced the city of Toledo, Ohio, to temporarily shut off its water intake system after samples were found to contain microcystin, which can cause liver and kidney damage and respiratory failure. Earlier this month, the Ontario and Canadian governments released a draft action plan to reduce algae blooms in Lake Erie, part of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement with the United States.  Mark Mattsen, president of Lake Ontario Waterkeeper, an environmental advocacy group based in Toronto, said the proposed elimination of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative would threaten the region’s $7 billion fishery. The cuts would end infrastructure plans to prevent the spread of the Asian carp, an invasive species brought to the United States 40 years ago to eat algae. It has destroyed numerous fisheries and is making its way toward the Great Lakes.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Long before the casino’s branch of L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon opened in December in a renovated space, Lesley Chesterman, a freelance food writer, began raising questions about both the lottery corporation’s selection process and the new restaurant’s cost to the government agency.  Photo  To her, the choice made little sense: An open-kitchen restaurant that exists in 10 other cities and has its headquarters in Paris seemed like a return to the first days of her career, in the early 1990s.  Back then, she said, “there was not one chef in Montreal who was Québécois. They were all French, all French maître d’s, all French wines, all French suppliers. France owned the city gastronomically until the moment when we started to do our own thing our own way.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The Casino de Montreal, a soaring, 657,849-square-foot complex on an island in the St. Lawrence River, is not an obvious setting for a pricey restaurant. It is housed in what was the French pavilion of Expo 67, the 1967 world’s fair. Much of the former fairground has been turned into a Formula One car racing circuit, and reaching the isolated casino from downtown involves an unsightly tour of concrete grain elevators and port buildings.  Exactly whose idea it was to franchise Mr. Robuchon’s restaurant is unclear. Loto Quebec declined to make anyone available for an interview. In a written statement, it said that “despite the unquestionably impressive culinary talent pool that exists in Quebec, we wished to set ourselves apart on the international scene in order to enhance our already exceptional Quebec offerings.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. McMillan and other chefs, including Normand Laprise of Toqué (between them, the two men run three of the top five restaurants in an annual Canadian ranking by chefs, restaurateurs, journalists and others), began challenging the decision on social media. They not only feel insulted, but they also see the government agency’s financing of the renovation and its financial arrangements with Mr. Robuchon as an unfair competitive advantage.  “Quebec has a lot of international-caliber chefs and creative newcomers,” Mr. Laprise wrote in an email. “All of us would have welcomed an investment such as the one offered to the casino for our different endeavors.”  Photo  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Just how much money is involved remains a mystery to the public. A figure of 11 million Canadian dollars for the renovations alone is often cited, although its source is unclear. In its statement, the lottery agency said only that the cost to build and outfit the restaurant “is below what has been suggested.” (Provincial information laws allow the lottery organization to keep contracts secret.)  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  As is the case with many of his outposts, Mr. Robuchon is largely absent from the Montreal branch. The 56-seat restaurant, one of several in the casino, is in the hands of its executive chef, Éric Gonzalez. Born in the south of France, he earned a Michelin star at the age of 27 at the restaurant Clairefontaine in Luxembourg.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  After four years in New York, he came to Quebec in 2000; when he was named to head the Robuchon restaurant, he was running the restaurants at the government’s casino in the Mont Tremblant ski area.  Photo  One recent afternoon, as his staff began setting places and preparing dishes for the evening service (the restaurant is open only for dinner, and is closed two days a week), Mr. Gonzalez praised the Quebec farmers who supply his lamb, cream and a small portion of his cheese. And his praise extended to several of Montreal’s chefs, including Mr. Laprise.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But Mr. Gonzalez was also adamant that the Robuchon franchise fills a void in Montreal’s restaurant scene. “I think Montreal now is more interesting because Mr. Robuchon has come into the city,” he said. “It is a very huge endorsement. I think what they needed was the big name.”  Over the past few weeks, criticism of the business relationship between the casino and Mr. Robuchon has escalated. Mr. McMillan and Ms. Chesterman appeared on “Tout le Monde en Parle,” a Sunday night talk show that draws about 1.3 million viewers in a province with a population of 8.3 million. And Carlos J. Leitão, the Quebec finance minister, has been peppered with questions about the arrangement during two sittings of the province’s legislature.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

When challenged by lawmakers, Mr. Leitão repeatedly defended the decision by Loto Quebec to team up with a prominent, if French, chef. “Is it a problem that a world-famous chef is promoting Quebec gastronomy elsewhere?” he asked. “My God! If these are the kind of problems we have to deal with, Mr. Speaker, bring them on.”  As irritated as Mr. McMillan is about what he sees as a government subsidy for Mr. Robuchon, he is equally adamant that neither he nor any of the other dissidents want to run the casino restaurant. If he had his way, the casino would have consulted all of the city’s principal chefs and hired a young cook they recommended.  “I’m just disappointed,” Mr. McMillan said, pausing to ask an employee, whom he called “brother,” to close a service door admitting a blast of cold air into Le Vin Papillon. “This was a great opportunity. What lack of vision, what lack of thought.”  “Quebec is sometimes a small town,” he added, then stopped himself. “Aah, can’t go there, I don’t want to be burned in effigy in front of my restaurant for saying the wrong thing.”","source":"nytamericas","date":"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 16:46:33 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Montreal Chefs Are Fuming Over a Casino’s French Import","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/dining/montreal-casino-chefs-loto-quebec-joel-robuchon.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-03-17T17:08:28.515Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"58cc342d7ae3a8493732ae1c"},"content":"But how to find such families?

That does not mean that you’ll leave thinking you have been played.”  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attended the Broadway production this week and was joined by Ivanka Trump, the daughter of President Trump. It was apparently part of Mr. Trudeau’s charm offensive against the Trump administration. But as a play about welcoming outsiders, “Come From Away” also highlighted the different approaches to immigration and refugees being taken by the two countries’ governments. “Now the show has turned unexpectedly into a form of Canadian soft power: an expression of Canadian ideals, seemingly at odds with those of the new American administration, on stage nightly in the heart of New York City,” wrote Michael Paulson in his report on the prime minister’s visit.

The investigation by Brazil’s Federal Police, an agency similar to the F.B.I., deals yet another blow to the country’s business establishment, which is struggling to recover from colossal graft scandals around Petrobras, the national oil company, and Odebrecht, a huge construction company.  In the newest corporate scandal, investigators said that employees at two food-processing giants, JBS and BRF, paid federal inspectors to ignore the adulteration or expiration of processed foods. Inspectors also falsified sanitary permits, and bribes were channeled to the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party of President Michel Temer, according to the authorities.  Rafael Cortez, a political scientist at Tendências, a consultancy in São Paulo, called the meatpacking inquiry “one more element that will add to the picture of political instability.” Brazil’s political establishment was already reeling from an array of other graft cases.  The meatpacking investigation also casts doubt on Brazil’s agribusiness industry, a relatively resilient pillar of the nation’s weak economy. JBS is one of the world’s largest meat producers, with the United States chicken processor Pilgrim’s Pride among its foreign subsidiaries. BRF is a major exporter of meat to the Middle East and Asia.

At the same time, the authorities said, inspectors turned a blind eye to practices like exporting meat contaminated with salmonella to Italy, raising the prospect that Brazilian meat exports could face restrictions in important markets.

Investigators said BRF sold a product labeled turkey sausage that had chicken and soybean protein substituted for much of the turkey, and that it adulterated expired meats with a type of acid that investigators said has been linked to cancer. These products were then sold to schools in the southern state of Paraná.  “Children in the public schools of Paraná are eating meals made of expired, spoiled meat or even carcinogens in order to bolster the interests of this powerful criminal organization,” Maurício Moscardi Grillo, a federal investigator, wrote in his description of the case.

Playing telephone  Photo  Some of the artists on Beebe’s expeditions went diving in helmets and tried drawing with zinc tablets and painting with oils under water. But they did not descend in the bathysphere. Instead, Beebe had a telephone inside it. He would call up to another researcher, often Ms. Hollister — who would lead her own expedition in 1936 to what was then British Guiana and also broke diving records as the first woman to complete a deep sea dive in the Bathysphere at 1,208 feet — who would dictate what he saw. Then, artists like Ms. Bostelmann, who painted this image of a fish chasing another fish’s larvae, would create their illustrations based on those dictations or specimens dredged up from below.

Ms. Cooper was a staff artist who joined Beebe on seven voyages including a 1925 expedition from New York to the Galápagos aboard the Arcturus. She obsessed over painting snake eyes and scales, preferring live snakes over dead, because the color was more vibrant.  The research team would bring specimens to the artists’ stations, or the artists would catch animals on their own. To paint the exotic living creatures, they had to improvise.

Even with the technical drawings, artists were given some creative freedom. Here Mr. Swanson technically portrays a praying mantis at the top, yet shows it doing ballet below. “It is really merging this idea of speaking to groups beyond the scientific elite,” said Ms. McLeod.  Searching for giant squid  Photo  Starting in 1922, Ms. Tee-Van, an accomplished New York artist, joined Beebe on 13 expeditions to then British Guiana, Haiti, Venezuela, Bermuda and Trinidad. She went on to produce illustrations, textiles and models for exhibits and books including the 1939-40 World’s Fair and the Encyclopaedia Britannica.  During the expeditions, Ms. Tee-Van dove into the water wearing a sixty-pound glass helmet to sketch passing creatures using a lead pencil and zinc plates. But one of her most notable works, this painting of a giant squid, was made from the body of an “undescribed species” brought up from about a mile beneath the sea.  In the 1980s, scientists and photographers started a quest to document the elusive squid depicted in this painting in a woman-led expedition called the Beebe Project which also had artists. They never found it. But in 2012, Edith Widder and two other oceanographers shot the first underwater footage of a giant squid off the coast of Japan.","source":"nytamericas","date":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 21:44:55 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Trilobites: They Mixed Science, Art and Costume Parties to Reveal Mysteries of the Sea","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/science/william-beebe-department-of-tropical-research-illustrations.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-03-27T22:01:35.313Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"58d9951fc3c39969547624aa"},"content":"(Want to get this briefing by email?

Jim Lockard, 65, and his wife, Dorianne Cotter-Lockard, 61, empty nesters, sold their California home, cars and most of their furniture just over two years ago and have been traveling — and working — ever since. They recently spent 16 weeks at Roam’s Miami location.  “We really like the co-working, co-living concept,” said Ms. Cotter-Lockard, who runs a leadership and organizational development consulting firm. Until recently, she said, they often booked accommodations through Airbnb, but internet connectivity “was hit or miss.”  Both said they enjoyed the weekly “family nights” and daily informal dinners, where people cook in a communal kitchen and dine together. “It gives us a home base and the opportunity to meet people from all over the world,” said Mr. Lockard, a former police officer and minister who now writes and coaches.

It found that only one in 10 believed location was important to a new hire’s success; nearly two-thirds said they had at least some workers who did a significant portion of their work from a remote location, and about half agreed that they had trouble finding the talent they needed locally.

Many companies do not have programs to train staff members to work effectively with remote workers, and labor and tax laws can be challenging.  “But the genie is out of the bottle,” she said, “and it’s not going back in.”  Low-cost locations like Bali and Chiang Mai, Thailand, have long attracted digital nomads, but now other destinations are reaching out. “It’s one of the trends we really need to understand if we want to be relevant,” said Signe Jungersted, director for development at Wonderful Copenhagen, the region’s official tourism organization. When highly skilled people stay for extended periods, it not only promotes tourism, but also attracts business and touches off innovation, she said.  “Travel has changed,” Ms. Jungersted said. “Everyone wants to be a temporary local.”  But Mr. Niland, from South Africa, said the benefits were global.  “The opportunity to go live in a foreign city for a month and interact with the local people and experience their culture — that’s priceless to me.

It would be a rare victory for the Latin American left, which has recently suffered stinging election defeats.  With more than 90 percent of the votes counted, Mr. Moreno, a close ally of departing President Rafael Correa, had won 51 percent of the vote, while his opponent, Guillermo Lasso, a 61-year-old banker, had won 49 percent, according to early figures published by Ecuador’s electoral commission.  While Mr. Moreno quickly declared victory on Sunday night, his opponent did not concede, saying all the votes needed to be counted.  The race was closely watched in the region, where, time and again, leftist stalwarts who rose to power on populism and high commodity prices have seen their fortunes turn.  Liberal movements in Venezuela, Argentina and Bolivia have been rebuffed by voters in recent elections as their economies have stumbled. Brazil’s leftist president, Dilma Rousseff, was brought down by impeachment last year.

Mr. Moreno has promised to push forward the so-called Citizens’ Revolution of his predecessor, which funneled state funds back to the poor in the form of education, housing and infrastructure.  In a speech on Sunday, Mr. Moreno said it became clear during his travels that he had the support of ordinary Ecuadoreans. “Since before we claimed victory, we knew it, we felt it,” he said.  Yet maintaining Mr. Correa’s momentum could prove hard. There is the issue of oil revenues, for one, which have stagnated. The economy has ground to a halt after years of high growth.

Mr. Lasso, from the port city of Guayaquil, had promised to cut back on what he called the excesses of the previous president, including by reducing the public-sector work force and government spending. He also proposed cutting taxes for the wealthy and for businesses.  Each candidate faced a steep climb to the presidency. Mr. Moreno was criticized for being too close to Mr. Correa, whose decade in power ended with accusations of corruption involving public infrastructure projects. Mr. Correa earned a harsh reputation for attacking critics, suing journalists and, on his state television show, angrily reading the names of those who had sent tweets that reflected poorly on him.

The country limped by in negotiations with creditors for years until Mr. Correa took Ecuador into default, calling the foreign debt “immoral.”  More recently, an Argentine newspaper published what it said were documents showing that Mr. Lasso had shuttled financial gains he made during the country’s economic crisis into an offshore account. Mr. Lasso denied wrongdoing, but Mr. Correa said the candidate was under investigation.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Moreno, by contrast, presented a softer image.  Known to be more humorous and conciliatory than Mr. Correa, he appeared in campaign stops in his wheelchair, which he has used since he was shot during a robbery in the late 1990s. He is probably best known for his social programs, which have helped people with disabilities in Ecuador.  “We can’t lose what’s been given to the poor,” said Edwin Tatés, who works as a driver in Quito and voted for Mr. Moreno.  He added, “This government has had many errors, above all those of Correa, who has fought with everyone, but we need to change things for the good of the country, not to change the whole government.”","source":"nytamericas","date":"Mon, 03 Apr 2017 02:54:37 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"In Ecuador, Lenín Moreno Headed for Victory in Presidential Election","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/02/world/americas/lenn-moreno-ecuador-president-election.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-04-03T17:22:45.515Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"58e2fed8c3c3994e1511b768"},"content":"Cellphone video shot during the gun battle showed two police officers approaching two men lying on the ground outside the school, picking up a rifle and shooting them dead.

While the court reversed the most disputed parts of its ruling on Saturday, that did not stop crowds from massing in a large middle-class Caracas district to accuse President Nicolás Maduro of trying to eviscerate Venezuela’s democratic institutions and establish one-man rule.  The National Guard and the national police arrived about an hour after the demonstration began, firing tear gas into the throngs and deploying trucks mounted with water cannon. Armed pro-government gangs harassed protesters and shot one person in the leg, according to Ramón Muchacho, the mayor of Chacao, a neighboring district. At least eight others were hurt, he told reporters.  “I march today to see my family reunited again,” said Lilian Tintori, an opposition activist whose husband, Leopoldo López, a former mayor of Chacao, is serving a nearly 14-year prison sentence.  Photo  The protest was the opposition’s most recent attempt to focus resentment against Mr. Maduro, who was seen as being behind the botched attempt last week to effectively dissolve the National Assembly. While the rally attracted large crowds, it failed to mobilize poor Venezuelans, whom Mr. Maduro’s leftist movement says it represents.  Last Wednesday, the Supreme Court, full of Maduro loyalists, removed all powers from the legislature, finding it in contempt and giving the judges authority to write laws. Mr. Maduro and the Assembly had been at odds since the opposition took control of the chamber in early 2016.

The federal judge, Claudio Bonadio, said there was enough evidence to indict Mrs. Kirchner for conspiracy over allegations that businesses rented properties from the real estate company, Los Sauces, in exchange for public works contracts and other favors.  For the first time, Mr. Bonadio also indicted the former president’s children, Máximo and Florencia Kirchner, in the case that includes charges of money laundering and negotiations incompatible with public office.  The charges could lead to prison sentences of up to 10 years if the Kirchners are convicted. Mr. Bonadio also ordered the freezing of assets of about $8.5 million each for Mrs. Kirchner and her son, and $6.5 million for her daughter.  Lázaro Báez, a construction tycoon in Patagonia who was detained last year in a separate money laundering case, and a casino magnate, Cristobal López, were also indicted along with 16 others.

The most emotional response has focused on conservative Muslim immigrants, who perhaps present the greatest contrast to traditional European-based culture and the secularism that Quebec struggled hard to win from the Roman Catholic Church.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The concerns are outsize by any measure. Muslims represent just 3 percent of Canada’s population, and while Islam is one of the fastest-growing religions in the country, Muslims will still account for less than 6 percent of the population in 2050, according to the Pew Research Center.  Nonetheless, Mr. Beaudry and his peers say they believe there is a real threat that Islamists are bending Canada’s tolerant culture to their will. The group’s main concern is political Islam pushed by the Muslim Brotherhood, the Pan-Arab movement that grew out of Egypt after the fall of the Ottoman Empire following World War I.  “Political Islam is slowly invading our institutions,” Mr. Beaudry declared, claiming that his group had documentary proof, though he was not prepared to show it. “We have to wake up people and shake them up, and then we will be able to bring change.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The theme is popular among right-wing groups across North America and Europe, where the slow integration of conservative Muslim immigrants into Judeo-Christian cultures has excited fears among some of a global culture war.  A 2004 move to set up Shariah mediation for Muslim family disputes in Ontario, which already allowed Jewish and Catholic faith-based tribunals to operate in the province, incited a national outcry.

He likened the group’s followers to the blue-collar Democrats in the United States who supported President Trump. “They are a new type of right, blending conservatism with some liberal values,” he said.  Some experts warn that groups like La Meute, however much they eschew violence, create an enabling environment in which hate can grow. “They are embedded in a broader cultural ethos that bestows ‘permission to hate,’” said Barbara Perry, a professor at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology who has written extensively on right-wing extremism in Canada.  The conversation within La Meute’s private Facebook page can border on hateful. In response to one person’s request about what could be done to prevent construction of a mosque in the neighborhood, another follower suggested pouring pig’s blood on the ground and letting Muslims know the land had been desecrated.

He said that the primary goal in founding La Meute was to educate members and others about the growth of political Islam in Canada.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Beaudry spoke specifically about the group’s opposition to the niqab and the burqa, Islamic styles of dress that cover women’s faces. Only a tiny sliver of the Canadian population adopts them, but “if people cannot blend with the society,” Mr. Beaudry said, “it becomes a cancer and if you want to save your life, you have to take action.”  He also believes a parliamentary motion passed last month that condemns Islamophobia is a move to silence criticism of political Islam and is the first step toward an Islamic anti-blasphemy law.  On the private Facebook page, La Meute’s leaders quiz followers, screening for the most informed and dedicated who might fill positions in the hierarchy.  Mr. Beaudry said La Meute was assigning followers to 17 geographic “clans,” each with officers and staff, “so people know who to report to and where to go when things happen.” He said five clans were “fully operational,” and he expected all to be formed by the end of the year.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Customs and Border Protection officers had the same discretion to screen travelers under the Obama administration, when Muslims and other travelers said they routinely endured intrusive and even discriminatory treatment. At this stage, the data available about customs officers’ activities does not support the charge that many more travelers are facing extra scrutiny.  Still, amid Mr. Trump’s attempts to harden American borders via wall, heightened vetting and a travel ban, the public is confronting a reality that went mostly unremarked in the past: In a country still struggling to define the balance between civil liberties and security nearly 16 years after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, customs officers wield broad authority over the millions of people who knock on the United States’ 328 gates each year.  In the limbo between leaving another country and arriving in this one, the officers have wide latitude to examine travelers, their baggage and their electronic devices while deciding whether to let them in. The rights that individuals, even citizens, are entitled to once inside the United States do not always apply while they are trying to enter it.

Even after travelers enter the country, the customs agency can keep their phones for weeks while investigators forensically peer into their contents.  Electronic device searches were already on the rise under the Obama administration, with the number of travelers whose devices were searched more than doubling from 2015 to 2016.

The produce section is especially cutthroat; here, because novel products are so rare, it’s the stories that must change to entice consumers. Back in the 1970s, the Chinese gooseberry went global — cultivated in New Zealand and shipped to the world — after being rechristened as the friendlier kiwi. Just a few years ago, kale was king, rehabbed as a luxury green after decades as a garnish and a Southern standby. Similarly, quinoa, long a staple crop in the Andes, has lately become a Western fixture, an ostensibly more primal alternative to rice. The latest entrant to this contest is Brazilian açaí, a purplish, antioxidant-rich stone fruit — though most call it a berry — foraged from trees in the Amazon River basin.  On an April Monday in Sherman Oaks, Calif., the Harvest Bar was packed with adults in athleisure, eating puréed açaí from bowls the size of flowerpots. The restaurant is a fast-casual “superfood cafe,” one in a growing class of health-food restaurants doing brisk trade in the açaí-bowl business, selling heaps of the puréed berries topped with diced fruit and other sweets. “The blend is like an ice cream,” the owner, Aric Haut, explained. “But healthy.” More than 5,000 miles to the south, harvesters in the Amazon basin of Brazil climb palm trees to pick the wild-growing fruit. What lies between these two distant parties is the latest unspooling of the food-fad plot — a supply chain driven by remarkable health claims, with money exchanged at every step along the way.  In the Amazon River basin, açaí — pronounced “ah-sah-EE” — has been eaten since at least the dawn of written history. The fruit, until the 1970s, was constrained to just this region, where local ribeirinhos, or “river people,” plucked it from trees and ate it as part of nearly every meal. As a weak jungle economy pushed ribeirinhos into cities, their gradual migration formed a distribution network. At first, they sold açaí from makeshift roadside carts. By the ’80s, they were shipping it to Rio and São Paulo, where it gained a reputation as prime fuel for jiu-jitsu. High in omega fats and low in carbohydrates and sugar, its sweet and earthy flesh is filling yet light. By the ’90s, Brazil had an açaí-bar scene. As the berry gained status, its price began to rise.  If the superfood plot were a bit more predetermined, you might expect açaí to go the way of quinoa. When the protein-rich grain spread to supermarket aisles and started to appear in fast-casual restaurants, it moved out of reach for the Bolivian farmers whose dependence on the grain made it famous in the first place. The story with açaí is not so simple. Here, surprising parties become heroes and scoundrels as the coveted berry changes hands in different ways.","source":"nytamericas","date":"Tue, 02 May 2017 09:00:03 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"The Money Issue: The Superfood Gold Rush","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/magazine/the-superfood-gold-rush.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-05-02T09:07:17.513Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"59091a88280b543d4586860f"},"content":"I did not anticipate the situation of João Lucas and Ana Vitória da Silva Araújo, twins whose different fates had overwhelmed their mother and caused the brain-damaged twin, João Lucas, to be placed with a guardian. These twins, more than a year old when I met them, became a window into much more than the Zika virus. Their story reflects struggles with poverty and lack of education; health care resources so scarce that people have to travel long distances just to get basic, low-tech services; the need for friends and acquaintances to take on ad hoc roles as substitute caregivers for children in crisis.  Together with Tania Franco, who served as a translator and fixer; Adriana Zehbrauskas, a photographer; and Gleidson Marcos, a driver who also made sure we were safe, I followed João Lucas and his guardian, Valéria Gomes Ribeiro, as they went from one appointment to another in the city of Recife.  Ms. Ribeiro, who was already a guardian for a teenager with developmental disabilities and had taken in an aunt with dementia, had stepped in to care for João Lucas. She is a cousin of a neighbor of his biological mother, Neide Maria Ferreira da Silva, who had given birth to 10 children before having the twins and proved unable to handle such an impaired baby.

He could not sit up or support his head on his own, and he had to wear leg braces even though he couldn’t crawl let alone walk. His medication sometimes made him so groggy he barely seemed to notice when a therapist at one clinic tried to stimulate his sense of touch by brushing his shoulders, back and arms with sponges. Yet at the next clinic he failed to stay still for a hearing test, so Ms. Ribeiro stood and rocked him repeatedly, despite her own fatigue.

From her front door, I surveyed the dirt streets rutted with muddy water, an upturned wagon languishing in the road. Ms. Ribeiro has had to forgo the extra money she once earned selling soda and candy on her small porch since it was converted into a makeshift bedroom for her ailing aunt.  Photo  We did not know if we would get to see the healthy twin, but suddenly Ms. da Silva showed up with Ana Vitória, who walked around in sandals and a yellow romper — alert, mischievous, affectionate. The women placed her on a bed next to João Lucas, so the twins could spend time together, and left the room. I stayed behind to observe, quietly taking photos and video on my cellphone. Although their bodies were the same size, I felt as if I were watching a newborn and his toddler sister.  João Lucas drowsed on his back, the green tape stretched on the backs of his fingers to unclench his fists giving his hands a skeletal look. Ana Vitória, between reaching over and grabbing his burp cloth and pacifier, played with a large stuffed whale.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “This is essentially a temporary foreign-worker program for the rich, with secret government subsidies for multinational corporations,” said Dermod Travis, the executive director of IntegrityBC, a nonpartisan political watchdog group based in Victoria, the provincial capital. “The government is selling B.C. as a tax haven for the global elite to park investment here, but not have to contribute.”  The provincial Ministry of Finance, which runs the effort, says it is a success, with 82 companies participating. Jamie Edwardson, a spokesman for the ministry, declined in an email to identify those companies or discuss the amount of refunds each has received, citing a ban on publicly disclosing taxpayer information in the law that created the incentives. He said the law protects taxpayer privacy.  At one point, the tax breaks were projected to create more than 13,000 jobs in British Columbia. According to ministry figures, though, fewer than 300 have been created as a result of the program, and possibly as few as 122.

Mr. Edwardson said these figures were the most recent available.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Experts say that with few public details, it is hard to tell whether the plan is worth the lost tax revenue. They also say the lack of disclosure prevents the public from knowing if companies are using the province as a pit stop on a global quest to avoid taxation. “There’s a real concern corporations are just stripping money out of places,” said Michael Knoll, a law professor and a director at the University of Pennsylvania Law School Center for Tax Law and Policy. “This lack of transparency is aiding that process.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The secrecy is unusual, experts say. A comparable tax-incentive plan in Montreal makes more information public, records show, including the names of participants.    In the United States, it is standard practice for state governments to release the names of companies receiving targeted tax breaks, including credits and rebates. Most states also share other information about participants that British Columbia does not, like the amount of money each company has invested and where that investment has gone, along with what the state has received in return, said Greg LeRoy, the executive director of Good Jobs First, an American nonprofit that tracks state tax-break programs.  The International Business Activity Act, initially passed in 1988, allows companies to claim a refund of up to 100 percent of their provincial corporate income taxes on a number of business activities, including lending, foreign exchange trading and investment management, which could bring a company’s tax rate down to 15 percent.  Photo  Over the years, the plan was expanded several times. In 2010, an expansion allowed high-paid nonresidents of Canada who work in British Columbia for participating companies to receive new generous tax breaks unavailable to Canadian residents.

Companies can receive refunds on real estate activities with foreigners, including mortgage loans on property in Canada for international buyers. Conducting the same domestic activities for Canadians would not qualify for the refunds. This has raised concerns that the tax refunds may encourage banks and other companies to prioritize foreigners over Canadians in Canada’s overheated housing markets.  The ministry runs the program. But the law that set it up requires participants to join and help finance a nonprofit, AdvantageBC, established in 1986 to promote British Columbia as a business destination. AdvantageBC advises its members on how to benefit from the tax breaks. The involvement of this group has also become a target for critics.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He defended the group’s involvement in the tax-break program. “On all issues, we are fully accountable to our members, which is where that accountability should be,” he said in an email.  As finance minister, Mr. Hansen repeatedly declared that expanding the program would help attract companies doing international business and “create those jobs in British Columbia.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In a recent interview, though, he said that its goal was really to enlarge the local financial services sector. “The program was not actually set up to be a job creator,” he said.  Mr. Hansen said most of the companies listed as “core members” on the group’s website were registered in the program. But he also said that some companies joined the group before seeking the benefits. He declined to provide a complete list of businesses. “Some companies are a little more sensitive about being included,” he said.

In 2014, the province expanded the program for foreign banks, which it said would raise the potential for investment from Asia, especially China. “These amendments to the International Business Activity Act send a strong message to foreign companies that B.C. welcomes their business, setting the stage for increased investment,” said Michael de Jong, the finance minister, according to a government news release.

The companies did not respond to requests for comment on whether they had received any tax breaks.  PacNet Services Ltd., a payment processing company, had been a core member of AdvantageBC since at least 2006. In September 2016, the United States Treasury Department listed PacNet as a significant transnational criminal organization for its “lengthy history of money laundering,” and froze the company’s American assets. The company has denied the accusations. Rosanne Day, PacNet’s president, declined to comment on whether the company was in the tax-incentive program and has received benefits.  After inquiries by The New York Times, PacNet, two associated companies that have also been sanctioned and several other firms were removed from AdvantageBC’s website last month.

The deal does not mean they will automatically be able to form a government. Because no party won a majority of seats in the election this month, the provincial political system gives the first right to form a government to the current premier, Christy Clark, the leader of the British Columbia Liberal Party, which won the largest number of votes.  Unless Ms. Clark can persuade opposition members of the Legislature to support her in a confidence vote, her government would fall.  Before Mr. Weaver made his deal with the New Democrats, he recognized the opportunity for the Greens to reshape politics in the province.

At the news conference on Monday, Mr. Weaver said the parties had come to an agreement on the Kinder Morgan pipeline, which he said was “critical” to his decision, but he declined to give any details.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has already approved the pipeline expansion, and what any government in British Columbia could do about that is not clear. Canada’s Constitution gives the federal government authority over pipelines that cross provincial boundaries.

In any case, legal challenges brought by indigenous groups and others may put the project in limbo, making action by the province unnecessary.  Mr. Weaver, who entered politics only in 2013, when he won a seat in the provincial Legislature, will have to do some delicate maneuvering when it comes to pushing other items on his party’s agenda.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The New Democrats favor positions in line with the Greens, including the limiting of mining and forestry. They do, however, conditionally support the liquefied natural gas initiative.  The economic importance of the forestry, pulp and paper industries to British Columbia may make it difficult, if not impossible, for the New Democrats to adopt any Green Party position that might limit production in the interests of sustainability and the mitigation of climate change.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In 2015, according to the most recent statistics available, more than 65,000 people worked in the sector, and the forestry industry produced 10 billion Canadian dollars in exports for the province. Many forestry workers are members of labor unions that were part of the initial formation of the New Democrats and that are major donors to the party.  The sector’s importance was clear when Ms. Clark suggested she might retaliate against the United States after the Commerce Department imposed a new round of duties on Canadian lumber last month in a decades-old trade battle.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In addition to working with the New Democrats, Mr. Weaver will face pressure from his own party.  “Environmentalists will definitely be reminding the Green Party where their base is,” said Emma Gilchrist, the executive director of DeSmog Canada, an environmental journalism organization in British Columbia. “They will have a very slim majority. It’s not going to be easy to get things done.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Still, Mr. Weaver’s bargaining position in the Legislature gives him leverage.  “There’s no question that Andrew Weaver is in an exceptional position of power,” said Maxwell A. Cameron, a political scientist who has studied minority governments in his role as the director of Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions at the University of British Columbia. “Not only does he get to choose what party he supports and put it in office, to some extent he gets to determine its policies.”  In addition to pushing its environmental priorities, the Green Party supports a ban on corporate and union political donations and a revamping of the province’s political system so that parties get legislative seats based on their proportion of the popular vote. The current system, in which seats are awarded to the candidate with the most votes in each electoral district, favors the two large, entrenched parties.

When the Green Party was formed in Canada, in 1983, it was the first green party in North America. Its fortunes have gone up and down since, often because of internal political struggles.

And while Mr. Bernier laid out a detailed and often provocative platform, Mr. Scheer offered few campaign promises that often dealt with small issues. His most significant vow was to end carbon taxes — but that stance was shared by most of the candidates, and such taxes are ultimately a responsibility of provinces, anyway.  Two factors add to the difficulty of predicting what Mr. Scheer will do as party leader now — or what he might do in 2019 if his party defeats Mr. Trudeau’s Liberals and makes him prime minister.  Mr. Scheer was elected to Parliament at age 25 and never served in any of Mr. Harper’s cabinets, which kept his public profile to a minimum. And from 2011 to 2015, he was the speaker of the House of Commons — a job that not only required him to be nonpartisan but also meant he could not propose or vote on legislation.

It was an apt choice of words. In political science speak, a “pacted transition” is one in which members of the elite, often within the government or its circle of allies, join forces with the opposition to replace a president or regime, hoping to protect their own interests. The term is generally used to explain how an authoritarian regime transitions to democracy, but it also offers a useful explanation of how impeachments work within democratic systems.

But others appear to have believed that a new government would shut down a corruption investigation that had implicated much of Brazil’s political and economic elite, and that Ms. Rousseff had refused to block.  Corruption depends on an “equilibrium,” the political economist Miriam Golden and the economist Ray Fisman have written. People pay or accept bribes because they think everyone else is doing it. As a consequence, graft can quickly spread through a system like a metastasizing cancer, taking hold across political institutions.  But when prosecutors or judges gain enough independence to investigate and prosecute corruption, widespread corruption suddenly becomes widespread vulnerability, creating an incentive for politicians to take drastic action to protect themselves.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In Brazil, some politicians seem to have seen Ms. Rousseff’s ouster as such a drastic but necessary step. In their recorded conversation, Mr. Machado said to Mr. Jucá that he wanted to see “the departure of Dilma,” saying that Mr. Temer “would form a government of national unity, make a major agreement, protect Lula and protect everyone.”  Photo  “This country would return to being calm,” he added.

But if the public opposes the transition, Mr. Pepinsky said, the government’s power and authority are undermined.

Much love, friendship and music in the backyard. All was good. Carmen Lopez, Winnipeg, Manitoba John Shields was a man of integrity. He stood up for his convictions and always fought for the working person. I do believe that Canada is a more compassionate society than that of the United States. We’ve also had governments that tried to hurt and divide us. Men like John Shields prevented this from happening in Canada. “Vanstar,” Vancouver, British Columbia My mother passed away two months ago and she chose life to her very end. Five years ago, doctors told us she was at the end of her life. Miraculously, she lived much longer than anticipated and got to see her then-2-year-old granddaughter turn 7 and get to know her and love her. I saw my mother suffer, especially during the last year, so I can totally understand why people would choose just to go. However, as Christians, we believe that our lives are brief moments, and that it is not so much about how we died; it is much more about where we will spend eternity. This, too, is respectful, just as the decision of this Canadian gentleman. As a Canadian myself, I will always advocate and be proud to live in a country where my rights and beliefs as a Christian are also respected, just as it should be for doctors who do not wish to facilitate euthanasia. This to me is the true sign of a civilized society. Patricia Gonzalez I have never read anything that moved me as much as this story. I am sitting here trying to see my keyboard through many tears.

Her national profile crystallized during the 2015 federal election campaign, when she became her party’s loudest voice opposing the Liberal Party’s stance on immigration. She promised that if her party won, the government would establish an anonymous hotline for reporting forced and underage marriages and practices that had been made illegal by an act of Parliament. Her argument was that members of conservative immigrant communities are otherwise reluctant to go to the police.  The country was already in a heated national debate about the Conservative Party’s effort to prevent a Muslim woman from wearing a face-covering veil while swearing the oath of citizenship, and the hotline idea was quickly attacked as a clumsy election-year stunt meant to appeal to anti-immigration voters. Many people believe those two issues cost the Conservatives the election, and Ms. Leitch later said she regretted making the hotline promise.

He agreed there should be a debate. But he also said Ms. Leitch and her supporters should produce evidence that a significant number of immigrants harbor un-Canadian values, and give specific examples of those that should be screened out in a test.","source":"nytamericas","date":"Fri, 26 May 2017 17:47:01 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Candidate’s Call to Save ‘Canadian Values’?

His account upset the commonly held wisdom that the discovery had mainly been the work of two inexperienced researchers from the countryside: Dr. Frederick Banting, a surgeon, and Charles Best, a recent college graduate who had yet to enter medical school.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The Nobel was awarded only to Dr. Banting and J. J. R. Macleod, the head of the university’s physiology department. Most earlier accounts viewed Dr. Macleod as undeserving of the honor, placing him on an overseas holiday while Dr. Banting and Mr. Best labored away.  But using newly released documents — including lab notes and contemporaneous papers that the university had long suppressed to avoid embarrassing the researchers — Professor Bliss detailed a far more complex, if no less acrimonious, story, revealing that the discovery was indeed a team effort by the three and, to varying degrees, others.  While chronicling the infighting among the researchers, “The Discovery of Insulin” also illuminated the science of endocrinology. Shelley McKellar, a professor of medical history at Western University in London, Ontario, who studied under Professor Bliss, said the book, like all of his work, was written in clear, nonacademic prose that made the subject accessible to the general public.

John William Michael Bliss was born in Leamington, Ontario, on Jan. 18, 1941, to Dr. Quartus Bliss and the former Anne Crowe. He grew up in Kingsville, a farming and fishing town just to the west. In early childhood, Michael, as he was known, would join his father when he was called out to perform his duties as the local coroner. For a while, he considered following his father into medicine.  But that thought was dispelled one weekend when the police came by their house with a drunk who been in a brawl and needed stitches. The man was ushered into his father’s home office.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “As I sat and watched on that Sunday afternoon in his consulting room,” Professor Bliss wrote, “with blood and alcohol fumes everywhere, reflecting on my own complete disinterest in and lack of all manual skills, I decided that this was not what I wanted to do in life.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  He met his future wife, Elizabeth Haslam, at a high school dance in Harrow, Ontario, another farm town. They married in 1963, and both studied at the University of Toronto. Mrs. Bliss, a retired teacher, survives him. Besides their daughter Sally, he is also survived by two other children, Jamie and Laura Bliss; a brother, Robert, and four grandchildren.  Robert Bothwell, another historian at the University of Toronto, said that Professor Bliss had favored writing his books — 14 in all — as expansively as possible. “A Canadian Millionaire” (1978), for example, is nominally a biography of Joseph Flavelle, a Toronto businessman who built his fortune starting in the meatpacking business. But the book is also a tour of the meatpacking trade and Toronto politics in the early 20th century, a portrait of a clique of Methodists who dominated business in Toronto, and a discussion of Canada’s role in World War I.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Professor Bliss had a sometimes uncomfortable relationship with other historians who studied Canada. Unlike some of their works, his business histories, while revealing flaws in both the character and practices of his subjects, were generally sympathetic toward them and business in general. And while he maintained that he was suspicious of all ideologies, his politics were decidedly conservative, if not in a partisan sense, during a time when Canadian history was more commonly viewed from the left.  Professor Bliss was among a small minority of Canadian intellectuals who favored the talks that led to a free-trade agreement between the United States and Canada in 1988, a forerunner of the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed in 1993.

Last year, in a video interview recorded for his induction into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame, Professor Bliss said that by the end of his career he had considered himself almost entirely a medical historian, and that he believed that his medical books were his most important works.  Among them are “Banting: A Biography” (1984); “William Osler: A Life in Medicine” (1999), about the renowned Canadian internist who helped found Johns Hopkins Hospital; and “Harvey Cushing: A Life in Surgery” (2005), about the pioneering American neurosurgeon and writer (whose own biography of Osler won a Pulitzer Prize).

She was well rested and happy heading to the hospice that morning. If she felt jittery, it was only because she was double- and triple-checking the procedure in her mind and making sure she was ready.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  She took the elevator to the third floor and walked down the hospice’s beige hall to Mr. Shields’s room. They talked intimately for a few minutes. She asked him if he still wanted to go ahead. He did.  She was convinced that he was of sound enough mind to make this decision. He signed the last page of official paperwork, confirming that he had been given the chance to change his mind and that he still wanted to go through with this.  Dr. Green instructed a nurse to set up his intravenous line while she slipped down the hall to go over the procedure with his friends and family.  She assured them that his death would be peaceful. He would simply go into a deep sleep and might even snore. But, if at any time it got too hard, they should leave the room. “There are no medals for staying,” she said. “There’s no judgment for leaving.”  Mr. Shields had asked five people to be there: his wife, his stepdaughter, Mr. Skovgaard, Ms. Fox and Ms. Allport, who was overseeing his death ceremony. When they entered his room, Mr. Shields greeted them with a smile. His blue eyes twinkled, matching a fresh aqua T-shirt. The quilt of unexpected kindness was spread over his legs.  The room was dark and cool. The overhead lights were off and one of the windows was open. Across its sill, an altar had been fashioned with cedar boughs, smooth stones, eagle feathers, a small red candle and a tiny bell. The emerald moss coating the limbs of a giant Garry oak tree outside glowed into the room.  Since Mr. Shields could not die in his garden, his garden had been brought to him.  A large white candle flickered on the night stand beside him. The hospital tray that had held his meals for the past two weeks was pushed to the side. Upon it was one of Dr. Green’s blue boxes, and eight syringes lined up neatly in a row.  The group formed a circle around Mr. Shields, with his wife at his head, touching his shoulder. He asked her what was happening, and she recounted what Dr. Green had said about the procedure, adding that he should go toward the light.  “Sounds perfect,” he said, giving a thumbs up.  It didn’t sound so perfect to her, she replied. It was as good as it was going to get, he said.  Ms. Allport began the ceremony she had designed with input from Mr. Shields and inspirations from a mix of cultural traditions.  She opened her arms wide, turned to each direction of the room and related it to Mr. Shields’s life. The east was the wind on which his beloved eagles fly. The south was fire and the snake shedding its skin, as he soon would. The west was water, filled with whales that passed his house. The north was the trees, like the thousands he had protected.  She had taken the bell from the windowsill and rang it between each turn, its tone bouncing lightly from the walls.  She called up to the sky and the heavens, and crouched down on the floor, thanking the earth for carrying his body for 78 years.  When she finished, she paused. There was not a sound in the room.  Mr. Shields, she said, would need ancestors to help guide his journey. They needed to be summoned. She asked everyone to mimic a movement she noticed Mr. Shields making recently: two hands placed on the heart and then swung open like saloon doors. If the names of ancestors came to their minds, they should call them out.  Ms. Hood whispered the names of his father, mother and former wife, Madeleine.  Mr. Shields opened his eyes and quietly said Rumi, the 13th-century Persian poet.  Ms. Sanchez held his right hand in hers, sobbing. Her nails were painted metal green, accentuating how pale his numb fingers had become. One of his regrets was that he could no longer feel a touch like this.  His wife leaned over and told him his love had been radiant. When she finished, he said, “Thank you, my darling.”  Mr. Shields then began singing a refrain from an old Gershwin Broadway tune: “Who could ask for anything more?”  The others joined in. “I got daisies, in green pastures. I’ve got my man. Who could ask for anything more?”  The singing came like intermission during a heartbreaking movie. Mr. Shields was delighting in life, right to the end. The ritual held the moment’s solemn structure; he was adding some human lightness. He did not seem afraid.  The day before, when Ms. Allport asked him if there was a poem he would like read, he asked for a Catholic one: The Prayer of St. Francis of Assisi.  Standing at his feet, Ms. Fox unfolded a copy. “Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace,” she began. Mr. Shields mouthed the words silently. He had left Catholicism almost five decades before, but Catholicism had not entirely left him. It was as if all the disparate strands of his life were being woven into this final moment.  Where there is hatred, let me sow love;  Where there is injury, pardon;  Where there is doubt, faith;  Where there is despair, hope.  “I think I’ve learned that lesson,” he said, when she finished.  For all of his openness and shared emotions, Mr. Shields was a stoic man. But when his wife told him that fires were burning for him on different islands, and that native elders were playing drums for him farther north on Vancouver Island, he closed his eyes and wept.  He talked about his father and his mother. In his life, he said, he had come to believe that everyone shared the same cosmic energy.  “We are all one,” he said.  He thanked everyone for their kindness. The sound of cars passing in the street below echoed up faintly through the window. Hands touched shoulders and hands.  Dr. Green leaned over and quietly asked him if he was ready.  By then, Ms. Allport had laid the white khata from the night before across Mr. Shields’s neck. His eyes were closed. He opened them and slowly scanned the faces around him, taking in each one.  “Are we ready, friends?” he asked. He turned his head to look at the doctor. “Yes, Stefanie,” he said. “I am ready.”  She took the first syringe from the table and screwed its tip into the IV catheter on the tender side of Mr. Shields’s left arm, then pressed its plunger down.  He closed his eyes. His face relaxed. He appeared to go into a deep sleep.  The only sound in the room was his stepdaughter’s crying.  One after the other, Dr. Green went through the syringes until none were left on the table. Mr. Shields’s body remained still. He made no grimaces. The only change was a slight yellowing of his face.  Dr. Green pulled her stethoscope from around her neck and listened to his heart. It was still beating.  A few minutes later, she did it again. And then, a third time.  Finally, 13 minutes after she had administered the first medication, she nodded to Ms. Hood. Mr. Shields was gone.  Photo  Going Home to His Garden  That evening, Mr. Shields’s body lay on a stretcher in his backyard. A large purple sheet was draped over his face and body, followed by a thick brown blanket — as though he had been tucked into bed.  His favorite black hat with the skipper’s brim had been pulled over his concealed brow, and a thin book of poetry slipped beneath his pillow: “The Subject Tonight Is Love” by Hafiz, a 14th-century Persian.  A beige canvas shelter protected him from the sprinkling rain. Boughs of cedar, white currant and flowering plum hung in bouquets from its corners, and its lip was decorated with prayer flags.  A candle flickered on a nearby table. Friends sat in chairs that were placed around him.  For Ms. Hood, the best part of this new way of dying in Canada was also the worst part. The scheduling tormented her and organized her. While her husband was intentional about his death, she was intentional about his final rites. They would be administered at home, by his loved ones, and not by the funeral industry.  She believed that her husband’s spirit would stay with his body for two days before journeying on. So someone was always in the garden with him — reading poetry, recounting stories or just sitting silently, keeping him company until he was taken to the crematory.  Neighbors dropped off food, wine and cords of wood for the fire, which burned continuously. At night, Mr. Shields’s friends stood around it and serenaded his still body and memory. It was spiritual and poignant, ritualistic and community-based.  “He would have loved it,” his wife said.  Those two days, the weather was fickle — the rain gave way to sun, the wind to calm, and then it rained again. Flocks of birds arrived. Deer and raccoons visited.  The majestic Douglas firs swayed above Mr. Shields. His garden was wild and beautiful, just as he had loved it.","source":"nytamericas","date":"Thu, 25 May 2017 09:00:29 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"At His Own Wake, Celebrating Life and the Gift of Death","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/25/world/canada/euthanasia-bill-john-shields-death.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-05-30T19:12:26.267Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"592dc41c280b5407eec69ebb"},"content":"“It is a bad sign at this moment; it could signal weakness from the government,” Mr. Nicolau said. “We are in a moment of insecurity, and any act of this type creates more insecurity.

The inspectors general found no evidence to support the agency’s version, disputing a claim that surveillance video showed evidence that the people on the boat had fired on the disabled vessel.  “Even as information became available to D.E.A. that conflicted with its initial reporting, including that the passenger boat may have been a water taxi carrying passengers on an overnight trip,” the report said, “D.E.A. officials remained steadfast — with little credible corroborating evidence — that any individuals shot by the Hondurans were drug traffickers who were attempting to retrieve the cocaine.”  The inspectors general also rejected the D.E.A.’s insistence at the time that the operation — as well as two others, in June and July 2012 — had been led by Honduran law enforcement officials.

But the agency’s own review was “little more than a paper exercise” in which a FAST supervisor conducted no interviews and merely collected written statements from agents who omitted material facts, the report said.  The D.E.A. accepted the report’s observations and recommendations.  “The loss of life and injuries which occurred between May and July of 2012 were tragic,” Mary B. Schaefer, the agency’s chief compliance officer, wrote in a response. “D.E.A. acknowledges that its pre-mission preparation was not as thorough as it should have been and that the subsequent investigation lacked the depth and scope necessary to fully assess what transpired that night.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Ms. Schaefer emphasized that the agency’s leadership had turned over since 2012 and that it had already made “significant changes in this area over the last five years.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In particular, she disclosed, the agency “has disbanded its FAST program.” It had its last deployment in 2015 and was subsequently renamed.

The Clinton administration shut it down after a plane crash in Peru in 1994 killed five agents.  During the Bush administration, the D.E.A. assigned Michael A. Braun, then the agency’s head of operations and a veteran of Snowcap, to develop a similar program for use in Afghanistan. Instead of being staffed with ordinary agents on temporary assignment, like Snowcap, FAST was intended to have a permanent role. It was overseen by a former Navy SEAL member, Richard Dobrich, and many of its agents were former military members. At one point it had five squads, each with 10 members.

Nevertheless, the transaction highlights the extent to which investors are willing to take on increasing levels of political and economic risk as they seek high-yielding investments when interest rates still hover near zero.  “There is a lot of interest in this trade,” said Carlos de Sousa, an economist at Oxford Economics, a research company based in London. “We are in a low-rate environment, and these are dollar bonds with really high yields.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Among the large holders of Pdvsa bonds are BlackRock, T.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But none of those firms carry Goldman’s reputation for being politically influential and financially opportunistic — a combination that has made it an easy global punching bag.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  At the root of what makes the bonds so attractive to investors, beyond their more than 20 percent returns, is the crucial role played by the Venezuelan oil company in providing foreign exchange to the embattled Maduro government.  While Venezuela has been in economic crisis for more than two years, the surge of people to the streets began after its Supreme Court, which is loyal to Mr. Maduro, tried to dissolve the country’s National Assembly in late March. The group of lawmakers, controlled by opposition parties, is considered the only government institution independent of the president.

Mr. de Sousa also points out that unlike pure sovereign bonds issued by the government, Pdvsa securities lack legal mechanisms, like collective action clauses, which can help a government negotiate favorable terms with foreign bond holders if it defaults on its debt.  Moreover, investors have noted that in the last year, as Venezuela’s economic situation has deteriorated sharply, the government has paid out billions of dollars to foreign investors holding the oil company bonds.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The Pdvsa trade is the latest sign that foreign investors are becoming bolder in investing in the bonds of governments in far-flung locales.  In recent months, higher risk countries such as Turkey, Russia and Brazil have been at the forefront of this trend.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Driving the bet, analysts say, is a view that emerging market economies, regardless of their political and economic challenges, are no longer willing to face the wrath of bond investors by defaulting on their debts.  That is because global investment giants like BlackRock and Goldman have become ready sources of financing, quick to lend billions in dollars or even local currencies, to governments in Africa, Latin America and Asia that in the past relied on banks.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Perhaps no country is as reliant on the kindness of risk-happy foreign bond investors as Venezuela. According to the research firm Exotix, Venezuela has a financing requirement of $17 billion in 2017, yet its central bank reserves are a paltry $10 billion.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  As investors see it, if you can buy a Pdvsa bond at 30 cents on the dollar, which also provides a double-digit yield, even if this government — or another for than matter — has to default, the gains made on the investment would be enough to overcome any loss.  While Goldman Sachs defended its trade by saying that it bought the bonds on the open market from a broker, bankers and traders say the money ultimately ended up in Venezuela’s treasury because the seller was an institution with ties to the government.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Nonetheless, the threat by Mr. Borges, the opposition leader, that a new government would not make good on these bonds seems unlikely.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  That is because these bonds carry covenants aimed at preventing an issuer from favoring one bond holder over another. So paying BlackRock or JP Morgan and not Goldman would open Venezuela to lawsuits.  All of which suggests that, despite the controversy over the Goldman trade, foreign investors will keep lining up to buy Pdvsa bonds.  “This is the only source of foreign currency the government has,” said Mr. de Sousa, the Venezuelan expert at Oxford. “So I think the government will continue to sell more of these types of bonds to foreign investors.”","source":"nytamericas","date":"Tue, 30 May 2017 23:45:33 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Goldman Buys $2.8 Billion Worth of Venezuelan Bonds, and an Uproar Begins","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/business/dealbook/goldman-buys-2-8-billion-worth-of-venezuelan-bonds-and-an-uproar-begins.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-05-31T00:10:59.036Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"592f6e51280b543530c69e92"},"content":"“A lot of the bureaucracy has been resisting a complete rollback” of Mr. Obama’s policy, said Christopher Sabatini, a Latin America specialist and executive director of Global Americans, a research organization. “Trump is the ‘Art of the Deal’ guy, and there’s no deal to be had here if they reverse the entire policy.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The dilemma is a familiar one for the president, who built his campaign and political persona around bold, contrarian policy pronouncements like building a wall on the southern border, instituting a Muslim ban and canceling the Paris climate accord, only to see his hopes for quick and simple action scuttled by thorny questions of law and policy, and resistance from the business community.  “I am confident the president will keep his commitment on Cuba policy by making changes that are targeted and strategic and which advance the Cuban people’s aspirations for economic and political liberty,” said Mr. Rubio, who has met with and talked to Mr. Trump and his top aides several times on the matter.

Among the measures the Trump administration is considering are proposals pressed by Mr. Rubio and Mr. Diaz-Balart to block transactions between American companies and firms that have ties to the Cuban military. Such a restriction could have far-reaching consequences for existing deals, such as the one struck by Starwood Hotels and Resorts last year to manage hotels in Cuba — one of which is owned by the military conglomerate Gaviota — and effectively freeze future ones, since the military in Cuba has a hand in virtually every element of the economy.

Muse, a Washington lawyer who specializes in American law regarding Cuba. “It would add one more obstacle to the obstacle course, which is already pretty complex.”  Mr. Trump, according to people close to the discussions, is also considering tightening restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba that were eased last year on the eve of Mr. Obama’s historic trip to Havana. The new policy allows Americans who are making educational or cultural trips to Cuba to initiate their own travel there without special permission from the United States government and without a licensed tour company.  Reversing it, or intensifying enforcement to require travelers to show evidence that their trips are legal, would probably slow the recent influx of American tourism to Cuba to a trickle, leaving airlines that have started direct flights there with fewer customers to serve.

Forged in secret by Mr. Obama’s top aides along with senior officials in the government of President Raúl Castro of Cuba during more than a year of clandestine talks, the official thaw between the United States and Cuba began with a surprise announcement in December 2014 and was then followed by a series of diplomatic and regulatory changes designed to be difficult to unravel.

Without a consensus, an announcement that had initially been anticipated on May 20, Cuban Independence Day, never materialized. A White House official said on Wednesday that Mr. Trump has yet to receive any recommendations for how to move forward, and while he would like to announce his new policy in June, there is no guarantee that he will do so, and no milestone date driving the process.

The answer may be different for each of them. Mr. Kushner has never talked, at least publicly, about the content of his meeting with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, or a later session with a Russian banker. That session has been described in various ways, as everything from a business meeting to an effort to open a back channel to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.

Whether he was trying to undermine sanctions placed on the country by the Obama administration is a matter of judgment — and of continuing investigation.  A central question, reported by The Washington Post, is why there was talk of conducting future discussions through Russian communication lines, presumably channels that the parties hoped could not be intercepted by the National Security Agency or the F.B.I. That would seem to suggest that the back channel was meant to be hidden from the sitting government.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “What is not normal,” wrote Eliot A.

Thomas Jefferson was an early enthusiast — he often routed around his secretary of state, once sending a secret letter to the American envoy in France, Robert Livingston, that contained a coded message.

But as Mr. Naftali wrote in Slate a few days ago, “The R.F.K. meeting likely came at the request of the Russians, not the Americans. It was not held in secret — it was noted on R.F.K.’s telephone log.”  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

I think the Kennedy brothers actually were following the rules about not trying to do foreign policy before the inauguration.” All the substantive talk of Berlin and Laos, he noted, happened after the inauguration.  The story of the Nixon effort to slow peace talks — which Nixon always denied — got new life early this year, just as the Trump administration’s communications with the Russians were underway. John A. Farrell found previously undiscovered notes at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in which Nixon told H. R. Haldeman, his most loyal aide, to “monkey wrench” peace talks in Vietnam. He worried that if Johnson made headway, it would help Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “Now we know Nixon lied,” Mr. Farrell wrote in The New York Times this year, describing the document, which he included in his book “Richard Nixon: The Life.” The instrument of the effort to sabotage the talks was Ms. Chennault, who was playing on the fears of the South Vietnamese president, Nguyen Van Thieu, that the Johnson administration was so desperate for a peace deal that it would happily sell him out.  Johnson considered trying to expose Nixon’s actions, and even put the F.B.I. on the task. “This is treason,” he said, according to tapes made in the Oval Office. But there was no solid proof.  What makes the current investigation different?  The obvious answer is the Russian meddling in the election.

I would gravitate instead to three central neighborhoods; a meal in Vitacura, a cocktail in Bellavista, and a stay in Providencia. Lastarria, a triangular barrio partly closed to traffic by Santa Lucía Hill to the west and Parque Forestal to the north, was off my radar. Lately, though, with a half-dozen hotels having opened in Lastarria in the last two years alone, not to mention dozens of new shops and restaurants, it’s where everyone wants to be.  Lastarria’s winding cobblestone streets and regal architecture are a stark contrast to the glass-towered commercial districts to the east, where the majority of Santiago hotels are concentrated. It feels almost European at times, with charming coffeehouses like Colmado Coffee \u0026 Bakery, which added a full-service restaurant on the second floor a year ago, and wine shops dedicated to independent Chilean winemakers now opening at a dizzying pace. Boutique hotels have taken up space in many of the 19th-century buildings while still meeting contemporary demands like rooftop pools and LEED certification.  A onetime intellectual enclave, Lastarria lost much of its luster over the last half-century as more modern suburbs rose farther away from the center, luring Lastarria’s wealthier residents. In 1997, it was designated a historic district by the city, encouraging the preservation of its architectural heritage. Many of the buildings were restored, and in 2002 an antiques and used-book market sprang up from Thursday through Sunday in the pedestrian-only Plaza Mulato Gil de Castro.

Pemberton, held in a picturesque spot about 100 miles north of Vancouver, British Columbia, was a typical entry into the frothy festival business. It was revived in 2014 by Huka Entertainment, a well-known independent promoter, after an earlier iteration failed. According to bankruptcy filings, the festival lost money for three years, and sold 18,000 tickets in 2017, down from 38,000 last year.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  After the cancellation, fans took to social media to vent and mock using the hashtag #PembyFest. The complaints were not quite the supernova that followed the dissolution of the Fyre Festival, when planeloads of millennials arrived to find a ramshackle site that was far from the luxurious beach paradise they had been sold.  But the collapse of both Fyre and Pemberton has once again focused the industry’s attention on what has become a perennial question: Has the ever-expanding festival market hit its peak? High-profile failures like Pemberton and Fyre — which is now facing numerous lawsuits from ticket buyers and others — could erode consumer confidence, Mr. Geiger said.  Then there is simply natural competition, as more festivals are added to the calendar.  “Well-produced and curated events at a site the public loves will continue to do well,” said Gary Bongiovanni, the editor of the trade publication Pollstar. “But too many events mean the best will survive and the weak will wither.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  World-famous events like Coachella began as risky endeavors undertaken by small promoters. If the credit markets for festivals grow too tight, there may be no room for such innovation, said Sam Hunt, an agent with Paradigm Talent Agency whose artists Major Lazer and Run the Jewels had both been booked for Pemberton.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “This industry thrives on a variety of creative individuals doing things in new and creative ways,” Mr. Hunt said. “If they become more constrained, everybody loses.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Geiger reserves a special ire for Pemberton’s investors, among them several wealthy Canadians with no background in the music business. As secured creditors, they now stand a better chance of getting their money back than the fans who paid $275 a ticket. One investor, Amanda Girling, is also chief executive of a company that owns the land on which the festival was held, and which is for sale for $12.5 million.

Ltd. — declared $5 million in assets and $12.5 million in liabilities, with ticket holders listed as having an unsecured claim of $6 million. The first meeting of creditors is scheduled for June 6 in Vancouver.  Further muddying the Pemberton situation are questions of control, with Mr. Geiger and others accusing the organizers of swapping shell companies for the investors’ benefit. In April, the investors created 1115666 B.C. and made it general partner of Pemberton Music Festival Limited Partnership, which controlled the festival.  William E. J. Skelly, a lawyer for the investors, said in an email that the new company was created to give the directors “greater management control and transparency” over the event’s finances.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Less than a month later, the investors resigned as directors of the newly formed company and, the very next day, declared both companies bankrupt.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “The fact that somebody decided to stick it to the consumer, not deliver any product, and say they are protected by bankruptcy, is hideous,” Mr. Geiger said.  Funds from ticket sales are often held by ticketing companies in case an event is canceled, but smaller promoters may depend on advances to pay expenses. Pemberton’s ticketing company, Ticketfly, paid the festival operators each week, Mr. Skelly said. Ticketfly declined to comment.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Geiger likened this process to the easy availability of credit before the housing crisis, and said the fallout from Pemberton meant that the financing arrangements behind festivals will most likely be tightened. Ticketing companies will be reluctant to pay advances, and artists will demand more money upfront, he said. If that happens, the only companies that could meet the multimillion-dollar capital requirements to stage a large event would be corporate players like Live Nation and AEG.  “It may be an advantage for the bigger guys,” said Peter Shapiro, an independent promoter behind Brooklyn Bowl and the Lockn’ festival in Virginia. “But for the new guys starting out, it’s going to be a much more difficult environment.”  Some longtime players in the concert industry see these developments as a consequence of the growing corporatization of the business. That process began in the 1990s and has gone through another wave lately, with small promoters bought out by Live Nation and AEG. In this landscape, independents are finding it harder and harder to compete.

But when he talked to students at Memorial University in Newfoundland, where he earned his Ph.D., he found that the term had become “context dependent,” he said in a telephone interview, meaning that whether or not it is offensive depends on how it is used and by whom.  It can be taken as either an insult or an endearing nickname these days, he said, and young Newfoundlanders don’t need a field guide to understand which is which.

While some of the others are also reporters, many of the Canadians lurking within The Times are editors, which means you usually don’t see their names.  Photo  That group includes Bruce Headlam, a proud son of Elmira, Ontario, and a staff editor on the Op-Ed page. Mr. Headlam recently produced two emotionally charged films in which veterans read passages from war plays written by the Greek tragedian Sophocles. Their intensity left me shaken. You should not miss them.  Read and watch: U.S. Veterans Use Greek Tragedy to Tell Us About War  Mr. Headlam shared some background on the videos:  The project had several influences, one Canadian. First, obviously, was Bryan Doerries’ Theater of War project, which uses Sophocles’ war plays to help veterans deal with trauma. Second, a smart young producer named Deborah Acosta at The Times had once spliced together a “Hamlet” from submissions by high schoolers, which she called InstaHamlet. Third, I saw a great production of Brian Friel’s play “Translations” at The Stratford Festival in Ontario in the early 1980s. The play is about the British-ordered eradication of the Irish language but it was full of beloved quotes from ancient languages. Mainly, though, I just wanted to do something The Times had never done before. In a similar vein, we at the Times Opinion section started a fully reported comic strip about a family of Syrian refugees called “Welcome to the New World,” and I can promise you The Times doesn’t do that kind of thing very much. And Times readers also benefit from different voices that can be heard without politics, or our own biases getting in the way. The veterans were all fascinating. Many had signed up after 9/11 because they believed that war required their personal sacrifice. Some had a high school education, others were Ph.D.’s and doctors, and at least a few were excellent writers. (I can’t recommend Phil Klay’s “Redeployment” highly enough.) Jack Eubanks, who read from “Philoctetes,” had such severe brain damage that it took him three years to relearn how to read and write, and he was told he could never go to college. He just graduated from Vassar and is starting graduate school in New York. They all had stories to tell about experiences few people will ever share. On top of that, many still feel betrayed by the United States government’s decision to invade Iraq under what we now know were false pretenses. Both “Philoctetes” and “Ajax “ deal with the theme of betrayal and with soldiers’ anger at generals. Such themes resonated with many of these vets.  Photo  By the way, Mr. Headlam also receives the credit (or blame) for bringing me to The Times. During the 1990s, Mr. Headlam edited my stories about technology for Canadian Business magazine (including one about an obscure email “pager” from a then-equally obscure company that became BlackBerry). After he was hired by The Times to help start Circuits, begun as a weekly technology section, I continued to write for him.  Since then, Mr. Headlam has held a variety of positions. You can see him in action as the head of the media desk and also acquire a good, if slightly dated, sense of what goes on in New York, in the documentary film “Page One: Inside The New York Times.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Pushy  Photo  One of the low points of a visit to New York can be running the gauntlet of hucksters in Lower Manhattan pushing tickets for sightseeing cruises around the Statue of Liberty.

Mr. del Mazo is a product of the party’s machinery in the State of Mexico, and a scion of P.R.I. royalty: His father and grandfather had been governors of the state, and Mr. Peña Nieto, who previously served as the state’s governor, is his cousin.

In some ways it is a microcosm of the country, embodying its extreme socioeconomic inequality, soaring corruption and rampant crime.  These problems have been a drag on Mr. del Mazo’s campaign, which has also been burdened by the unpopular performance of Mr. Peña Nieto.

They urged voters to break the party’s dynastic control as the best way of ridding the state — and by extension, the nation — of corruption and finally curbing rampant violence.  In a poll published last week in the Reforma newspaper, a majority of respondents said it was time for another party to run the state, and nearly half said they would “never” vote for Mr. del Mazo.

Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the pugnacious head of the left-wing National Regeneration Movement, whose candidate was the runner-up in the preliminary count, said Monday that he would demand an examination of ballots and suggested that the P.R.I. had engaged in fraud to secure victory.

According to preliminary results, Alfredo del Mazo Maza, the P.R.I. candidate, had 33.7 percent of the vote. His closest rival, Mr. López Obrador’s handpicked candidate, Delfina Gómez Álvarez, had 30.8 percent.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But if his political history is any indicator, his challenge to this week’s election results are far from over.  In the 2006 presidential election, Mr. López Obrador lost to Felipe Calderón by less than a percentage point and disputed the results for months, including rallying his supporters to the streets of the capital, where they set up blockades for weeks to demand a recount.  In 2012, he was again the runner-up in the presidential election, by about seven percentage points, and challenged the outcome in court. He charged that the winner, the current president, Enrique Peña Nieto, had engaged in widespread vote-buying and overspending on his campaign.

Photo  The election results in general — with two-thirds of votes going to opposition candidates — also revealed the widespread disillusionment with the governing party regionally and nationally.

But the State of Mexico was the crown jewel of governorships, serving as a major engine of the party’s nationwide power. The party has been accused for years of rerouting funds from the state till into key regional and national campaigns.

Efforts to form coalitions repeatedly failed.  “The P.R.I. will keep on winning as long as the opposition remains divided,” said Denise Dresser, a political analyst.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In addition, analysts said, the opposition put up, to varying degrees, weak candidates. Ms. Gómez, for instance, was a virtual unknown in politics, though she sought to use that to her advantage, saying that she was free of the corruption charges that can dog veteran politicians.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Indeed, her low profile and unassuming presence served the charismatic Mr. López Obrador’s interests, too. While Ms. Gómez was the nominal face of the campaign, Mr. López Obrador was the dominant lurking figure, and he explicitly tied his presidential ambitions to the regional race.  Mr. López Obrador’s overbearing presence became a liability in the final days of the campaign, several analysts said, when his ambitions and political feuds seemed to eclipse Ms. Gómez’s efforts to promote her platform.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But some analysts also attributed the P.R.I. victory to the use of political favors and, they said, the party’s expert use of dark electoral arts. While most political parties in Mexico have been accused of employing techniques like vote-buying and intimidation, the P.R.I., in its decades-long dominance of Mexican politics, demonstrated an unparalleled expertise.  During its monopoly of presidential politics, stretching from 1929 until its first defeat, in 2000, the P.R.I. achieved many of its electoral victories by employing increasingly sophisticated methods of fraud and coercion.  The party recovered the presidency in 2012 with Mr. Peña Nieto’s victory, saying it had cleaned up its act. But opponents contend that the party has been slow to shed old habits.  The agency that monitors electoral crimes has opened more than 230 cases into irregularities associated with the State of Mexico campaign, more than double the number in the last election for governor six years ago.

Although President Trump has backed away from his threat to pull the United States out of that regional trade accord with Mexico and Canada, the administration has given few clues as to how hard a line it will take.  Talks could begin as early as August.  “Conducting the negotiation on sugar trade against the background of a broader renegotiation of Nafta gave the United States significant bargaining leverage,” said Eswar Prasad, a trade expert at Cornell University. “A ratcheting-up of trade tensions could well have poisoned the broader negotiations, an outcome that Mexico clearly wanted to avoid.”  The outlook for the coming Nafta talks did play a part in the calculations of the Mexican sugar industry, said Juan Cortina Gallardo, the president of Mexico’s sugar chamber.

In an interview with Televisa of Mexico on Tuesday morning, Mr. Guajardo said regular contact with Mr. Ross over the sugar dispute had helped build a relationship of “credibility and confidence.”  The deal also lifted the threat of Mexican retaliation against $500 million in American exports of high-fructose corn syrup, a substitute sweetener.

But under Nafta, Mexico won unrestricted access to the American market beginning in 2008.  After a bumper crop in 2013 that doubled Mexican exports, American producers filed a complaint of unfair trade practices. In response, the Commerce Department imposed punitive duties as high as 80 percent.

But the American sugar industry, led by several large refining companies including the ASR Group in Florida and Imperial Sugar, argued that the agreements did not do enough to protect them.  The agreement struck Tuesday keeps the 2014 agreements in place but lowers the percentage of refined sugar Mexico can send to the United States to 30 percent of its exports, from 53 percent. It also lowers the level of purity at which Mexican sugar can be sold as refined sugar.  In response, Mexico has the option to supply 100 percent of any excess demand from the United States each year. The American Sugar Alliance said its objection to the accord was related to the conditions under which Mexico would meet that excess demand.","source":"nytamericas","date":"Wed, 07 Jun 2017 00:28:22 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Mexico Agrees to Sugar Trade Deal, but U.S. Refiners Remain Unhappy","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/business/economy/sugar-nafta-mexico-trade-trump.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-06-07T01:14:10.694Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"5937661e280b541974317c32"},"content":"Photo  OTTAWA — Canada will increase its military spending and its activities in international organizations as the United States seems to be stepping back from its international role, the country’s foreign affairs minister said on Tuesday.  “The United States has truly been the indispensable nation,” the minister, Chrystia Freeland, told the House of Commons. “For their unique, seven-decades-long contribution to our shared peace and prosperity, and on behalf of all Canadians, I would like to profoundly thank our American friends.”  She then went on to suggest that era had come to a close.  “Many of the voters in last year’s presidential election cast their ballots animated in part by a desire to shrug off the burden of world leadership,” she told the chamber, never mentioning President Trump by name. “The fact that our friend and ally has come to question the very worth of its mantle of global leadership puts into sharper focus the need for the rest of us to set our own clear and sovereign course.”  The stated purpose of the speech was to outline the Canadian government’s foreign policy priorities. “On the military front, Canada’s geography has meant that we have always been able to count on American self-interest to provide a protective umbrella beneath which we have found indirect shelter,” Ms. Freeland said.","source":"nytamericas","date":"Wed, 07 Jun 2017 02:16:58 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Canada Will Pursue a More Robust Global Role, Minister Says","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/world/canada/canada-military-spending-trump-freeland.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-06-07T02:34:06.131Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"5940061c280b547146317c51"},"content":"Instead, he was arrested and taken to a detention facility on the edge of the Everglades.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Coello’s case drew extensive media coverage in both Miami and Caracas and, eventually, the intervention of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. The senator helped secure Mr. Coello’s release, though he could still be deported.  The case may have been a sign of just how far the government is willing to go to carry out President Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.  “It’s very unusual — almost unprecedented — that ICE would arrest an asylum applicant who is at a U.S.C.I.S. office waiting for their asylum interview,” said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell Law School.  He was referring to two agencies that are part of the Department of Homeland Security but, as Mr. Coello discovered, have very different missions: United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, which handles citizenship and asylum cases, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which arrests people believed to be in the country without permission.  In the first three months of the Trump administration, ICE agents arrested some 41,000 people, an increase of nearly 40 percent over the same period last year. At the same time, the administration has expressed a desire to be stricter about allowing people into the country with asylum claims, as most such claims are ultimately rejected.  When Mr. Coello was taken to the Krome detention center, another asylum seeker was already there.  Photo  Denis Davydov, who fled Russia as an H.I.V.-positive gay man, had been on his way back to San Jose, Calif., from a vacation in the United States Virgin Islands. Though it is an American territory, travelers heading to the mainland must pass through Customs and Border Protection — also part of Homeland Security — and when Mr. Davydov did so, he was arrested. Agents flew him to Miami and sent him to Krome, shackled and chained at the wrists and ankles.  Despite his pending asylum case, Mr. Davydov still appeared in the system as having overstayed his original visa. “They would not let him go because he would still be found inadmissible to the United States,” said Jaime I. Ruiz, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection. Mr. Davydov, like Mr. Coello, has been released but still faces potential deportation.  “My fear is that going forward this is business as usual,” said Aaron C. Morris, executive director at Immigration Equality, a nonprofit group that provides free legal representation to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. The group is handling more than 650 open asylum cases. “We’re doing our best to advise the community about this new danger without scaring them all.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Coello’s case is all the more striking given that Mr. Trump has attacked Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, who has used antiterrorism laws and military tribunals to prosecute political rivals. Mr. Trump has even called for the release of the opposition leader Leopoldo López from prison. Mr. Coello said that his Venezuelan interrogators tried to coerce him into implicating Mr. López but that he refused.  Mr. Coello’s problems in the United States most likely began when he became drowsy working as a driver for the ride-hailing service Lyft and pulled over to sleep in a parking lot. A police officer rapped on his window, telling him it was private property and writing him a ticket. He was convicted of misdemeanor trespassing and paid a fine of $100 and $92 in court costs, according to court records in Fairfax, Va.  That conviction brought him to the attention of ICE. “Marco Coello has one misdemeanor criminal conviction and did not depart the country in accordance with his visa,” said Nestor Yglesias, an ICE spokesman, referring to the tourist visa he had arrived on. “As a result, he violated the terms of his nonimmigrant status in the United States.”  Paul Wickham Schmidt, a retired immigration judge who is now an adjunct law professor at Georgetown University, said that ICE agents could legally arrest individuals in asylum proceedings. “Otherwise everyone could absolutely immunize themselves from removal just by filing with the asylum office,” he said.

But arresting Mr. Coello was also indicative of the Trump administration’s new priorities, he said. “As Jeff Sessions keeps pointing out, anyone here illegally shouldn’t feel safe,” Mr. Schmidt said, referring to the attorney general under Mr. Trump.  Mr. Coello was a high school student in El Hatillo in southeastern Caracas when he joined marches and demonstrations across Venezuela on Feb. 12, 2014, to protest Mr. Maduro, a close ally of Hugo Chávez who took office after Mr. Chávez’s death in 2013.  The protests that day turned ugly, with violence between government forces and civilian protesters, who in some cases threw Molotov cocktails. Mr. Coello, who said he was not involved in the disturbance, was struck on the leg by a tear-gas canister and fell to the ground. Security personnel in plainclothes began to beat him and took him into custody.  According to a report by Human Rights Watch, based on interviews with Mr. Coello and five others arrested, the security forces put a gun to his head and doused him in gasoline. “They wrapped a thin mat around his body, tied it with tape, and approximately 10 officers kicked him and beat him with sticks, a golf club, and a fire extinguisher on his ribs and upper body,” the report said. He was tortured with shocks and told to confess to burning the vehicles. He refused.  Mr. Coello was accused of arson, among other charges related to an alleged attack on the Venezuelan attorney general’s office. After months in detention, he was released pending trial and fled to the United States with his father. His mother later joined them.

When he and his lawyer, Ms. Blandon, arrived at his asylum appointment in April, they were passed off to ICE. “We walk in, she didn’t even introduce herself,” Ms. Blandon said of the Citizenship and Immigration Services official who met them. “‘We can’t entertain your claim for asylum. These two gentlemen from ICE can explain.’”  After articles appeared in the local and Spanish-language news media — “Joven torturado en Venezuela es arrestado en Miami por inmigración” was the headline of one article in El Nuevo Herald — Mr. Rubio, a Republican from the Miami area, contacted Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff.  The next day, Mr. Coello was released.  Mr. Coello will still have the opportunity to plead for asylum in immigration court. His arrest was legal, but some experts question whether it was the best use of limited resources in an overburdened system.  “In years of doing these, I’ve had probably only a few dozen cases where somebody can point to their name in a State Department human rights report and say, ‘That’s me,’” Mr. Schmidt, the former immigration judge, said of Mr. Coello.

After two years of negotiations with the authorities and a face-off with the landowner — whose claim was tenuous, Mr. Ortiz said — the city seized the land.  One summer night, Caratina García, then a mother with two young children, and a few other women stood up to the police who had been sent by the quarry’s owner. “They threw tear gas, but even then they couldn’t remove us,” said Ms. García, now 67. “They never came back.”  “We had the right” to the land, Ms. García said. “We had been paying rent all along.” Somewhere in her tidy room she still has all those rent receipts.

But in the 1970s, women had few legal rights, and all but a few of the co-op’s 247 founding members were men. Some signed the founding document with only a thumbprint.  Co-op ownership would provide a bulwark against real estate speculation, Father Escamilla reasoned. All decisions were made in a weekly meeting of all members.  With possession of the land assured, Mr. Ortiz led a team of idealistic planners and architects who designed a self-contained community with the same road leading in and out of Palo Alto, to fend off speculators trying to chip around the edges.  Each house had the same layout, with options to expand as families grew. With little money to pay construction workers, Mr. Ortiz designed brick and ceramic building panels that women and children could make. Houses went up over the next several years, and the community was established.  In the 1990s, as development began on the towers of the Arcos Bosques office complex next to Palo Alto, the co-op rejected an offer to sell.

Two decades ago, about 40 co-op members demanded the right to sell their property. The dissidents, as they are known, sued, creating a conflict that persists today.  A 2015 court ruling guaranteed Palo Alto’s residents the right to their housing. But they must buy out the dissidents, at a cost Mr. Márquez estimated at more than $1 million.  Most of those who grew up in Palo Alto and emerged from its poverty treasure the co-op. As dusk fell across his lunchroom Mr. Ortega finished his story.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story  They belong to the Simón Bolívar Musical Foundation, known to Venezuelans simply as El Sistema, Spanish for “the System.” For four decades, the state-financed program trained hundreds of thousands of musicians across social classes, an achievement unheard-of anywhere else in Latin America and one that has left the music world in envy.  El Sistema’s youth orchestra toured the United States during years of tense relations between the countries. Its young prodigy, Gustavo Dudamel, became an international star and now leads the Los Angeles Philharmonic. A source of national pride, the classical music program was one of the few institutions that seemed exempt from Venezuela’s growing polarization, and was protected by successive governments in return.  “In its 42 years, El Sistema somehow managed to keep an impartial position,” said Ollantay Velásquez, the director of Mr. Cañizales’s orchestra. “It has stayed that way until today.”  Yet the young man’s death is rupturing that neutrality, underlining the kinds of dilemmas faced across Venezuela’s institutions as street protests approach their third month, with at least 67 people dead in the turmoil.  From Los Angeles, Mr. Dudamel broke his silence about the protesters’ demands, dedicating a concert in Mr. Cañizales’s memory from the stage in May and issuing a fiery statement against the government’s repression of demonstrators.  “We must stop ignoring the just cry of the people suffocated by an intolerable crisis,” Mr. Dudamel warned. “I raise my voice against violence. I raise my voice against repression.”  In Venezuela, orchestra members have played memorial concerts for Mr. Cañizales, using performances to denounce government officials as traitors. Other musicians say they are now following Mr. Cañizales’s example in the streets as well, heading into the front lines of protests with their instruments in tow.  Photo  On a recent afternoon, Wuilly Arteaga, 23, stood in the center of a crowd of demonstrators, his violin on his shoulder. His case was strapped to his back, his helmet painted with the colors of the Venezuelan flag. He played the national anthem.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Explosions of tear gas canisters erupted between the notes he played. Finally, other protesters grabbed him by a shoulder and dragged him back from the security forces.  “I remembered my friend Armando,” Mr. Arteaga said afterward. “I have spent ages now playing and living on the streets, and I see that so many talented Venezuelans have had to eat from the trash.”  Anthony, another classical musician, now spends his days on the front lines of the clashes with security forces, dodging tear gas canisters and rubber bullets. Some of the instructors have told him not to go, he said.  “They’ve begged us not to become polarized, not to show our political stripes,” said Anthony, who asked that his full name not be used because he feared reprisals. “Many of us go out concealed.”  Like most teenagers, Mr. Cañizales grew up under former President Hugo Chávez and his leftist movement, which took power in Venezuela the year he was born.  Mr. Chávez, a populist buoyed by oil prices that skyrocketed after he came to power, used the money to reshape the country’s political and economic order, expropriating foreign assets, building thousands of public housing units and schools, and directing profits from Venezuela’s state oil company toward the poor.  El Sistema was founded long before Mr. Chávez’s movement, in 1975, by José Antonio Abreu, a conductor working with an initial class of 11 students in a parking garage. But Mr. Chávez soon saw it as a driver of change in the country’s poorest neighborhoods and a way to raise Venezuela’s cultural profile abroad.

Around age 10, Mr. Cañizales took up the viola. Though he had planned to be a doctor one day, the instrument became an obsession for him — no less than “his life,” recalled Jesús Pérez, his El Sistema professor.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  He loved Beethoven, said those who knew him. He practiced Georg Philipp Telemann, a Baroque composer whose Viola Concerto Mr. Cañizales once played in a recital, perhaps with a bit of stage fright, missing a few notes.  “He played for the love of it,” said Mr. Velásquez, the orchestra conductor.  Mr. Chávez died in 2013, replaced by a handpicked but much less popular successor, Nicolás Maduro, who soon was saddled by falling oil prices. By 2015, basic foods, once imported by the government cheaply on oil dollars, had become scarce, demoralizing the country.  El Sistema was beginning to suffer as well.  Salaries of teachers were eroded by inflation, which reached triple digits. Basic maintenance of the main concert hall in the capital, Caracas, was neglected, and it suddenly flooded one night in 2016. Cascades of water dripped on the timpani drums stored there.  Photo  “Just to put strings on a viola became impossible,” recalled Mr. Pérez, the teacher.  Yet Mr. Cañizales “was a boy of few words,” Mr. Pérez said. The teenager kept his own counsel, and few said they had known he was considering joining the street protests when they began to erupt in late spring.  May 3 was a tumultuous day in Caracas. An armored vehicle drove into a crowd of protesters who attacked it. Four opposition lawmakers were wounded in clashes. Even the leftist attorney general came out that day to condemn the police repression as excessive.  In another part of the city, young protesters were throwing rocks at a long line of national guardsmen. In a video clip, recorded by a Venezuelan journalist for an online news site, a lone figure wearing a backpack and a helmet appears, approaching the guardsmen from a distance with his arms outstretched. The man is Mr. Cañizales.  There is no record of the shooting.

The president also faces scrutiny over other matters, including claims he negotiated a $40 million bribe in 2010 for his centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party. Mr. Temer denies the accusations, and Brazilian law is thought to prevent sitting presidents from being investigated for such acts committed outside their terms in office.

The questions were largely about his ties to food-processing executives who have negotiated a plea deal revealing an intricate bribery scheme and to a top aide arrested after accepting a suitcase holding more than $100,000 in cash related to the scheme.  Judges on the electoral court who voted against Mr. Temer lamented the outcome of the case. Even excluding the testimony about illegal financing by Odebrecht, they cited as evidence millions of dollars of payments made to the 2014 campaign in exchange for contracts with the national oil company, Petrobras.  “As a judge, I refuse to be a gravedigger of living evidence,” said Antonio Herman Benjamin, the judge who oversaw the case and voted against Mr. Temer. “I can even take part in the funeral, but I won’t carry the coffin.”  Still, others on the court took a different view. In his televised closing argument, Napoleão Nunes Maia Filho, 71, a poet and a judge on the electoral court who himself is ensnared in graft scandals, went off on an unusual tangent in which he expressed his desire to see his detractors feel the “ire of the prophet.”  Judge Maia Filho then made a slicing gesture with his hand imitating a decapitation, before apologizing and casting his vote in Mr. Temer’s favor.  The ruling is fueling new doubts about the efficacy of Brazil’s electoral courts, which absorb hundreds of millions of dollars each year to oversee a system permeated with corruption.

But in these charged times, just breaking bread with a world leader can take on a political subtext. It is a tension his advisers recognize, and say they try to mitigate by holding get-togethers at Mr. Obama’s hotel and avoiding the trappings of leader-to-leader meetings.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “We recognize if he goes to a foreign country and meets the leader of that country, there is an interest, given the unusual circumstance we’re in,” said Benjamin J. Rhodes, who advised Mr. Obama in the White House and still goes with him on overseas trips. “He’s really trying not to have these be platforms to weigh in on the issues of the day.”  The challenge, Mr. Rhodes acknowledged, is, “How does he do it without looking like the leader of the global progressive resistance?”  The former president’s situation is complicated by the fact that he remains extremely popular in most of the world — starkly contrasting with Mr. Trump — meaning foreign leaders can easily use a meeting with Mr. Obama to their political advantage at home.  Mr. Trudeau lost no time tweeting a picture of himself at dinner with the former president, adding a post, in French and English: “How do we get young leaders to take action in their communities? Thanks @BarackObama for your visit \u0026 insights tonight in my hometown.”  Mr. Renzi, whom Mr. Obama feted in his last state dinner at the White House, is plotting his own political comeback after resigning in the wake of a failed Italian referendum last December. During their meeting in Milan, Mr. Renzi suggested they place an impromptu call to another friend of his, Emmanuel Macron, who had just won the French presidency.  Photo  Mr. Obama had broken his stay-out-of-politics vow to endorse Mr. Macron. The former president viewed it as “almost an emergency election,” Mr. Rhodes said, given that a victory by France’s far-right leader, Marine Le Pen, would have meant another Western country lost to a populist tide.  The alliance between Mr. Obama and Mr. Macron draws an inevitable contrast to the new French president’s relationship with Mr. Trump. It began in Brussels with a death-grip handshake and continued when Mr. Macron frowned visibly as he watched Mr. Trump scold NATO members for not paying their fair share for the upkeep of the alliance.  In that speech, which came after the two presidents lunched, Mr. Trump also failed to reaffirm America’s commitment to the mutual defense clause in the NATO alliance — although he reversed that stance on Friday. Mr. Trump’s omission in Brussels caught his national security team off guard. One official said the president and his senior adviser, Stephen Miller, tinkered with his remarks after seeing Mr. Macron.

With atmospherics like that, diplomats said, Mr. Obama could not help but be viewed as a kind of antidote. “With Trump’s rude, insulting and destabilizing NATO trip, Obama hardly needs to go out of his way to remind people how disastrous Trump is for the trans-Atlantic alliance,” said Philip H. Gordon, who was assistant secretary for European affairs in the Obama administration. “The comparison is inevitable and, I’m sure, doesn’t bother him.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  For Mr. Obama, the irony is that while he was president, he was criticized for keeping his distance from foreign leaders and not cultivating the kind of friendships that Bill Clinton or the elder George Bush did.  But Mr. Obama did befriend a small circle of mostly European leaders: Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Cameron, and later in his presidency, Mr. Renzi and Mr. Trudeau. His recent meetings, Mr. Rhodes said, have been driven less by political symbolism than by a desire to maintain these friendships.  In the case of Ms. Merkel, Mr. Obama last year accepted her invitation to appear on a panel on the occasion of the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther’s Reformation. Tens of thousands of people gathered at the Brandenburg Gate last month to listen to Mr. Obama praise Ms. Merkel for her “outstanding work, not just here but around the world.”  On his next trip, to South Korea in July, Mr. Obama plans to see Lee Myung-bak, a former president with whom he developed a rapport while in office. But even there, politics could intrude. South Korea’s new president, Moon Jae-in, recently halted the deployment of an American missile-defense battery designed to protect the South from North Korea.  Mr. Trump ruffled feathers during South Korea’s presidential campaign when he demanded that Seoul pay for the system. The next day, his national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, called South Korean officials to clarify that the United States would pay for it.  Over time, Mr. Rhodes predicted, people would lose interest in Mr. Obama’s meetings with foreign leaders. Some Europeans argue that beyond the gauzy symbolism, that is already happening.  “It was nice for the chancellor to have him in Berlin,” said Norbert Röttgen, a foreign affairs expert in Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party. “He is a striking contrast to his successor.

He is the past.”","source":"nytamericas","date":"Sat, 10 Jun 2017 01:14:50 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Obama’s Global Visits Inspire Wistful Comparisons of Then and Now","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/09/world/americas/obama-trudeau-dinner.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-06-13T15:35:10.000Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"59400630280b547146317c58"},"content":"But more important, after the legal wrangling, states in the Northeast and Midwest forged ahead and brought in their own laws to cut emissions, largely solving Canada’s problem.

New subway cars from the Montreal-based company for its hometown are four years behind their original schedule, partly because someone eventually figured out that they were too big to fit through some Metro tunnels.  Toronto’s attempts to relieve Tokyo-style overcrowding on major streetcar routes with new jumbo-size articulated models from Bombardier have been plagued by a long list of delays. And many of the streetcars it did actually receive were defective.  Most recently, the regional transportation authority in Toronto gave up hope that Bombardier will deliver trains in time for the opening of a new crosstown light rail system and placed an order with one of its competitors. That dispute has been a bit of a bonanza for litigation lawyers, of course.  While it may not entirely be consolation for Canadian commuters, they are not alone. The Times’s Marc Santora reports that New York City’s C train has become one of the low points in its subway system in part because of production problems afflicting new cars being made by, yes, Bombardier.

Pirate — or as it later became, Irate — Joe’s filled that void in Vancouver, British Columbia. But no longer.  Read: Pirate Joe’s, Maverick Distributor of Trader Joe’s Products, Shuts Down  Dissident  In the lead up to the sesquicentennial edition of Canada Day, the country is in something of self-congratulatory mood. Not joining in, however, is Jesse Brown, a journalist and host of Canadaland, a podcast that covers the news media, politics and other aspects of Canadian society. He is an author of “The Canadaland Guide to Canada,” a satirical look at the nation’s symbols and myths that was published this spring.  My colleague Dan Levin recently spoke with Mr. Brown about the book:  Why did you write this book? The mission of the book is to take down the erroneous global image of Canada as the world’s nice guys, largely because it’s doing us a disservice. I don’t think it’s possible to mature as a country without an honest conversation about indigenous genocide or that we had slavery and have anti-black racism. We’re selling arms to Saudi Arabia that are killing people in Yemen, and we are still plunderers of our natural resources. All those truths we need to contend with are out of reach because we’re so committed to this P.R. campaign, taught in schools as gospel truth, that we’re peacekeepers. Why was the book, which contains a lot of rude and vulgar political content, “published in America,” as it states on the front cover? You couldn’t really publish this book in Canada. There are a lot of funny people in Canada, but there’s never really been a biting satirical book in this country. I don’t think that’s for lack of trying. Between libel and copyright laws and a fear of stirring the pot, we tend to do political humor that’s very chummy. Canadians often say that Americans are ignorant about Canada and need to learn more about their northern neighbor. Is that a valid complaint? Why should Americans know any more than they do about Canada? It’s projection. Canadians only want positive attention. We want Americans to regard us as what to aspire to, as America without guns or the vicious discourse. But we don’t have enough of a vicious discourse, we have a very polite country and as a result, business, political and media elite are very interconnected. If we want Americans to care about us, the stuff that makes us interesting is the stuff that we don’t want them to know about.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “Patients want to know what is the likelihood their baby could be damaged. At least now, I feel like I had some numbers I can utilize in counseling.”  C.D.C. researchers classified cases by the trimester in which the laboratory test was conducted or symptoms were reported, said Peggy Honein, the chief of the birth defects branch at the C.D.C. That “may not represent the precise timing of infection.”  The data reported to C.D.C. came from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Marshall Islands, American Samoa, and the United States Virgin Islands.  In total, the agency counted 122 babies with possible Zika-related birth defects, such as neural tube defects, eye abnormalities or microcephaly, an unusually small head.  Previously, Puerto Rico’s department of health had only reported about 35 cases in which a fetus was lost or baby was born with Zika-related birth defects, raising concerns that the extent of damage to infants has been underplayed on the island.  On a call with reporters, Dr. Anne Schuchat, the acting director of the C.D.C., replied, “We do believe that Puerto Rico authorities are doing a very good job right now in evaluating babies whose mothers had Zika infection, and characterizing them and reporting in.”  On Monday, Puerto Rico declared that its Zika epidemic had ended, based on data showing the number of new cases had fallen. Regardless, C.D.C. officials said today that they still advised pregnant women to avoid traveling to Puerto Rico and to protect themselves against mosquito bites, if they do.

Dr. Tom Frieden, the former director of the C.D.C., said of Zika, “It may not be epidemic anymore, but it’s endemic” in Puerto Rico.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “What we often see with this type of infection, it’s really bad in the first year and less bad in future years,” he added. “That’s why C.D.C. has retained its travel guidance.”  Dr. Frieden also cautioned that this report “is a minimum estimate of the number of infants who may be Zika-affected,” in Puerto Rico, because not all women whose infections were confirmed in the first trimester have given birth yet.  “The report mentions that only 18 percent of pregnancies they identified were in the first trimester, while you’d expect it to be a third,” he said.  Testing pregnant women for Zika will be routine in Puerto Rico, Dr. Schuchat said.  Women who do not have any symptoms of Zika virus still may give birth to a baby with Zika-related birth defects, research has shown. The only way to catch those infections is to screen women because they may have been exposed to Zika-infected mosquitoes or may have had sexual contact with an infected partner.  In this new report, “The presence or absence of symptoms was not predictive of whether a baby would be damaged,” Dr. Riley said. “There were women who had asymptomatic Zika whose babies were damaged.”  Currently, only about 60 percent of babies born alive in United States territories had results of Zika laboratory testing reported to pregnancy and infant registries. It’s important that all babies who may have been affected are monitored, as early intervention can help.  For instance, some babies who appear normal at birth later develop an unusually shrunken head. Only with long-term tracking can health officials get an accurate estimate of the scope of the problem.  Even now, Puerto Ricans often do not take every precaution to avoid Zika infection. In another C.D.C. report released on Thursday, roughly 88 percent of residents with a recent birth said they had used screens on doors to keep mosquitoes at bay.  But 56 percent of roughly 1,800 sexually active pregnant women reported never using condoms to protect themselves from getting Zika from a sexual partner.","source":"nytamericas","date":"Thu, 08 Jun 2017 23:25:06 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"5% of U.S. Pregnant Women With Zika Had Baby With a Birth Defect","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/health/zika-birth-defects-cdc.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-06-13T15:35:15.400Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"59400637280b547146317c5a"},"content":"His bulk shopping trips got the attention of Trader Joe’s, and in 2013, the company filed a lawsuit against Mr. Hallatt for trademark infringement, unfair competition, false designation of origin and false advertising.

In August 2016, a federal appeals court sent the case back to the lower court for a trial, which was scheduled to take place in November.  Mr. Hallatt, who had personally spent about $75,000 in court costs, was trying to raise $50,000 by the end of this month to put toward the $250,000 he needed. As of Thursday, a little more than $5,700 had been raised, according to an online fund-raiser.  On Wednesday, the two sides reached a settlement.  “They definitely didn’t want me to be a business,” said Mr. Hallatt, who had agreed to close the store.  A spokesman for Trader Joe’s, which is based in Monrovia, Calif., declined to comment on Thursday.  Mr. Hallatt had been banned by Trader Joe’s from setting foot in its stores, but he had devised ways to shop undetected and keep his enterprise afloat.

For all the attention his business garnered, its closing happened with little fanfare. “Thank you to everyone who has ever supported us,” he wrote on the store’s Facebook page. “We are sad that it had to come to this, but hey, at least we had some fun while we were at it right?!”  He closed the doors at 9:30 p.m. to put one of his daughters to bed, and returned to find people still lined up outside.  At the end, the shelves were mostly bare, and Mr. Hallatt rang up the last customer a minute into Thursday.  The customer bought gluten-free pancake mix, matcha green tea mix and shortbread cookies with dark chocolate filling.  He threw in a bar of organic milk chocolate — his favorite.","source":"nytamericas","date":"Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:55:57 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Pirate Joe’s, Maverick Distributor of Trader Joe’s Products, Shuts Down","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/business/pirate-joes-trader-joes-vancouver.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-06-13T15:35:19.096Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"59400638280b547146317c5b"},"content":"As Venezuela sinks further into crisis, new forms of protest have emerged both inside the country and abroad.

They include Fernando Gaviria, who sprinted to four stage victories at this year’s Giro, and Esteban Cháves, who finished among the top three at last year’s Giro and Vuelta a España.  Photo  These riders “are not made all by themselves,” said Jorge Ovidio González, president of the state-run Colombian Cycling Federation. “They can’t just jump on a plane and go to Europe” and win races.  Instead, he says, many come up through a network of cycling leagues and clubs that train on three rugged Andean ranges — something that has helped Colombia become Latin America’s cycling superpower.  The cycling federation headquarters attest to this rich history, with black-and-white wall photos of greats like Luis Herrera, known as “Lucho,” who in 1984 became the first Colombian to win a stage in the Tour de France and was the first to win the Vuelta a España three years later. Herrera, Quintana and other mountain specialists are known here as “escarabajos,” or “beetles,” for their doggedness in grinding their way up hills.  González said his organization provided bikes and equipment to up-and-coming escarabajos, showcasing them at major races where they are courted by European pro teams. He recalled personally escorting a nervous Quintana to the 2011 World Championships in Copenhagen. Back then, he said: “Nairo was just a 21-year-old kid. He was clueless. He didn’t talk at all.”  González, who has held top positions at the cycling federation for two decades, questioned Quintana’s motives for speaking out, noting that the heads of the country’s cycling leagues re-elected him to his post in January over a candidate backed by Quintana.  “This is all about politics, not sports,” González said.  Still, the criticism comes from a broad range of cyclists and close followers of the sport.

But many have fallen on hard times because of a lack of funding and allegations of mismanagement and corruption.

Jay Inslee of Washington. Both back the agreement, and Canada hopes to coordinate its climate efforts with their states, she said.  On Monday, Mr. Trudeau made it clear that Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the accord would not change the bigger Canadian strategy — without mentioning either the president’s name or that of the United States.  Photo  “Canada will not back down from its commitment to fight climate change — and we are not alone,” the prime minister said after kayaking briefly with Ms. McKenna to observe World Environment Day. “Around the world, nearly every country is on our side.”  Then on Tuesday, in a sweeping speech to the House of Commons, Chrystia Freeland, the foreign minister, said, “We will continue to seek opportunities for constructive progress on the environment, wherever we can find them, with our counterparts in Washington and across the great United States, at all levels of government and with partners in business, labor and civil society.”  The Canadian government has not entirely given up on the administration in Washington, Ms. McKenna said in an interview on Monday. She said she would again push the issue during meetings with Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, at a gathering of Group of 7 environment ministers in Rome which begins on Saturday.  Privately, though, officials in Canada acknowledge that it is unlikely that the Trump administration will reverse its stand, making working with states and local governments even more critical.  In both the United States and Canada, federal governments set the overall rules and regulations on environmental policy, but as a practical matter the states and provinces are largely responsible for putting them into effect. Carbon taxes and cap-and-trade systems, for example, are established at that level.  About two and a half months ago, Mr. Trudeau’s government divided up the United States among its cabinet members based somewhat on past relationships to work on climate issues, as well as on trade matters. For example, Marc Garneau, the transport minister who met with William Peduto, the Pittsburgh mayor, has also been to Florida, where he spent several years as an astronaut and flew on three space shuttle flights.

Other states, like Indiana, the home of Vice President Mike Pence, were picked because of their ties to the Trump administration.  Although the early meetings were heavily trade-focused, climate change is now expected to assume greater importance.  Photo  The strategy has some potential risks. States cannot conduct diplomatic relations, so there is no mechanism for them to assume Washington’s role in international climate change bodies.  “It’s one thing for California to talk to Quebec or British Columbia about carbon trading,” said Kevin Book, a research analyst with Clearview Energy Partners in Washington. “But it’s quite another to suggest that states replace the United States at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. There’s no reason for Canada to invite that conflict.”  Also, Mr. Trudeau’s government potentially risks clouding the relationship with the Trump White House if it is seen as overtly undermining the president’s agenda within American borders.

While Canada has a large automotive industry, the cars and trucks it produces are overwhelmingly exported to the United States. That makes setting unique emissions or fuel economy standards for the Canadian market economically unviable. But California, one of the world’s most important car markets, has long been ahead of the United States government on emissions rules. Canada now plans to work closely with the state as it again effectively becomes the American vehicle emissions regulator.  “There’s certainly no question that California is a world leader and is leading the United States on vehicle emissions,” said Mr. Garneau, Canada’s transport minister.  Mr. Garneau said he anticipated that a group of experts he just gathered to recommend zero-emission vehicle rules for Canada would closely watch California’s decisions.  Coming directly after the president’s speech, the meeting between the mayor and Mr. Garneau centered on the role of transit in reducing emissions, as well as trade issues.  “U.S. states and cities are reaching out and soliciting this kind of contact,” said Paul Bodnar, the managing director at the Rocky Mountain Institute in Boulder and a former climate policy adviser to the Obama administration. “Previously states and others often played second fiddle to the federal government on the international plane. Now, for the first time, governors and mayors are in the international area.

The protests are meant to out the Chavistas leading a cushy existence here, make their daily lives more uncomfortable or drive them out of the country altogether. Once word gets out through social media, news quickly spreads among exiles here and people back in Venezuela.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  These more personal acts carry great emotional impact but can also generate substantial criticism because they are often held outside private houses or even inside establishments where Chavistas are confronted tu-a-tu, or person to person.  The more personal a protest, the more visceral it becomes for both sides. Last month, a former minister in the Chávez government, Eugenio Vasquez, was having breakfast with his partner at Don Pan, a popular Venezuelan bakery in Doral, when a customer recognized him. The customer approached Mr. Vasquez and started to denounce him. Soon, others in the bakery joined in, a moment captured on video, as most of the protests are.  “Fuera, fuera” — get out — they shouted. “Rata,” one person said, using the Spanish word for rat. “Ladrón” — thief — another person said. With emotions roiling, Mr. Vasquez and his partner stood up and quietly left the bakery.  These kinds of encounters with Chavistas and Maduro supporters — some occurring by chance, others by design — are not limited to Florida. They occur all over the world, particularly in Spain, another hotbed of anti-Chavismo activism.  Recently, outraged opponents of the Venezuelan government trailed Spain’s Venezuelan ambassador down the sidewalk clanging pots and pans; they threw garbage at a senior diplomat; and at a bakery counter in Madrid, they shouted “asesino,” assassin, at a general manager of a Venezuelan corporation, pointing out that while he was enjoying bread and sweets, people in Venezuela were dying of hunger. On Bondi Beach in Australia, two women shouted down the daughter of the mayor of Caracas as she ambled down a boardwalk, asking her in Spanish, “Tienes miedo?” — are you scared?  Video  Public shaming can employ other tactics, as well. The most famous is the escrache, a more organized, collective naming-and-shaming that typically unfolds in front of someone’s house or small business. It was first popularized by Argentines who sought to denounce the perpetrators of Argentina’s “dirty war,” a conflict in the 1970s and ’80s in which 30,000 dissidents and subversives “disappeared.” The victims became known as “los desaparecidos,” and their relatives fought back with escraches after the officials were granted amnesty for their crimes.  Spain used the tactic effectively in 2013, during the country’s economic recession, when people were routinely evicted or displaced from their homes. To pressure politicians to change the eviction law, Spanish protesters would share their grievances about the law’s pernicious effect, said Cristina Flesher, a professor at the University of Aberdeen who has written books and papers on escraches.  “It takes a lot of different forms, but really it’s a collective bearing of witness rather than a single instance of an outraged person on the street,” she said. “The key is to maintain the moral high ground.”  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In Miami, protesters have held several escraches in the past year at the houses or businesses of Venezuelans they call “enchufados,” or people who are “plugged into” the government. Many of them are organized and vetted by Mr. Colina and his group, Politically Persecuted Venezuelans in Exile. Mr. Colina, a former Venezuelan military officer, fled the country for Miami in 2003 after being accused by the Chávez government of planting bombs in Caracas. The United States decided not to extradite Mr. Colina.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  When exiles learned that a former deputy in the Venezuelan government, Iroshima Jennifer Bravo, had moved to Miami and opened a spa in Doral last year, they checked property records and then held an escrache in front of the spa. Ms. Bravo closed the business.  “We do these escraches so that word gets back to Venezuela,” said Jani Mendez, 45, who has taken part in eight of them. “They are hypocrites.”  Last month, exiles in Orlando stood outside the home of a former admiral of the Venezuelan Navy. With a megaphone, a spokesman for the group made sure that the man’s neighbors in the luxury development knew exactly who he was and what he had done.  “In this house lives Aniasi Turchio,” the spokesman said. “This is the type of person who has told the people of Venezuela, who are hungry, who don’t have medicine, who are eating out of garbage cans, that socialism is good and that the imperialists are hurting the country, and look at how they live.”  But Dr. Flesher said escraches can also backfire unless protesters are organized, rule-oriented and sure of the wrongs the Chavistas have committed. In Miami, protesters recently held an escrache in front of the Weston house of a former Venezuelan judge, who was accused of collaborating with the Venezuelan government. In fact, the judge, until her resignation, had earned praise for her integrity and was responsible for freeing Henrique Capriles, Venezuela’s opposition leader. Her only offense is living in Weston with a former vice minister in the Chávez government.  “I never made decisions influenced by politics,” Dayva Soto, the judge, posted on Twitter after the episode. “And I resigned to warn others that the independences of Venezuela’s judges were at risk.”  Venezuelan exiles later acknowledged it was an error to focus on the judge rather than on her husband.  “In terms of effectiveness, it’s all about credibility,” Dr. Flesher said. “The minute you stray from things that are verifiable, you open yourself up to attack.”","source":"nytamericas","date":"Wed, 07 Jun 2017 22:02:13 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Venezuelan Exiles in Miami Turn to Public Shaming of Maduro Supporters","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/07/us/venezuelans-miami-maduro.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-06-13T15:35:29.636Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"5941e25f280b54679487812d"},"content":"Most of those arrested come from El Salvador and Honduras.

He visited Long Island in April and spoke with local law enforcement officials, vowing to eradicate the gang by cracking down on illegal immigration.  “There are times when we know someone is an MS-13 gang member, and we know someone is an active MS-13 gang member, but we’re not in a position to make a criminal arrest,” Timothy Sini, the Suffolk County police commissioner, said in an interview. “So another tool in our toolbox is to work with the Department of Homeland Security to target active known MS-13 gang members for violation of civil immigration laws, which is another way to remove dangerous individuals from our streets.”  The arrested men face a variety of consequences. Some had re-entered the country after having been deported once, which is a federal crime, and will face prosecution. Deportation proceedings will begin for some of those not facing criminal charges.  Jorge Tigre, 18, was one of the young men found dead in April, murdered in a manner “consistent with the modus operandi of MS-13,” Mr. Sini said at the time.  Mr. Tigre’s brother William Tigre, originally from Ecuador, said on Wednesday that the arrests would not make a difference. “My brother’s not here anymore,” he said. “If they catch them, you know, that’s not going to solve the problem.”  There are just too many MS-13 members, Mr. Tigre said.  “Nothing’s going to change,” he said.","source":"nytamericas","date":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 01:08:26 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"39 Members of MS-13 Are Arrested, Authorities Say","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/nyregion/ms13-gang-members-arrested.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-06-15T01:26:55.873Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"5941e261280b54679487812e"},"content":"“He was a rare original thinker who based his conclusions on a wealth of research that forced others — even others with very different perspectives — to take his views seriously,” said Dimitri K.

Nixon as a nonpartisan foreign policy research and advocacy group.

Officials with the administration of President Ronald Reagan had claimed that the government was verging toward pro-Soviet totalitarian socialism.  Mr. Leiken’s conversion was cited in a speech by Mr. Reagan and provided an intellectual foundation for Washington’s support for the Contras, the rightist guerrillas who were seeking to overthrow the Sandinistas.  Mr. Leiken “was undoubtedly the single most important person outside of the administration to make Americans aware of the Sandinista government’s agenda to institute a Cuban-type repressive Communist state in Nicaragua,” Ron Radosh, an author and historian, wrote this week on pjmedia.com, a news and opinion collaborative blog.  Mr. Leiken argued in The New Republic that “there is no monolithic pro-Soviet left in Central America,” and he warned that Washington should embrace only governments that demonstrated “consistent support for human rights.” In 1990, in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times, he also correctly predicted that the Sandinistas would lose a forthcoming election.  If conservatives figured that Mr. Leiken, like Mr. Radosh, had permanently abandoned his liberal roots, Mr. Leiken surprised them, too, a decade later.  In 2007, he and Steven Brooke wrote in Foreign Affairs that Washington policy makers should recognize that the feared transnational Muslim Brotherhood was, in fact, a relatively moderate group and a sworn enemy of Al Qaeda that could be engaged in negotiations.  “He was early to point out that the Muslim Brotherhood is a moderating force in the Middle East,” Peter Bergen, the national-security journalist and author, said in a phone interview, “and that, of course, is not how it’s interpreted in Saudi Arabia, where it’s banned, or in Egypt, where it’s criminalized.”  Mr. Leiken also sounded an early alarm against homegrown jihadist terrorism in Europe, a warning he repeated in his book “Europe’s Angry Muslims: The Revolt of the Second Generation” (2012).

Sanction entities that fund jihadis, pursue an international accord against ransoming hostage takers and prepare a counterterrorist unit” that could “summon precise airstrikes, but only against global terrorist training camps.

I was 9 years old, and I had already developed a tortured relationship with the Roughriders, familiar to any of the million-odd people who live in the province where I grew up. Until that point in the club’s 79-year history, the Riders had taken home just one title; in an eight-team league, this fact seemed to defy the laws of statistics.  With the game soon to begin, we placed wagers on the outcome. I knew everyone would pick the Roughriders, out of loyalty if nothing else. Sensing opportunity, I chose the Tiger-Cats. It was a win-win, I thought: In the unlikely event of a Riders victory, I could rejoice; if they lost, I would be, by a 9-year-old’s standards, rich. I had already learned not put my faith in the team.  In a stunner, the Riders won 43-40 after a field goal with nine seconds remaining. The team soon reverted to form, and wouldn’t win another championship until 2007, when I was living and working in Beijing. I followed that game online from my desk at work, and when I saw the clock run down, the Riders still up by 4, my eyes dampened. In my life, there’s not a team in any sport in any place that means more to me than the Roughriders, an obscure, often mediocre club from a windy city, Regina, where I haven’t lived in 18 years and where I have no family left. It sometimes seems as if this football team is one of the last tethers I still have to the place that made me.  Canadian football isn’t rugby or Australian-rules football; it has much more in common with the American version of the game. But it’s like American football in the way Canada itself is like America: just similar enough to arouse what Freud called the “narcissism of small differences.” Canadian football is played with three downs instead of four, and with 12 men to a side instead of 11. The C.F.L. field is 110 yards long and 65 yards wide, and the end zones are 20 yards deep instead of 10. Touchdowns are 6 points, and field goals are 3, just as in the N.F.L., but there is also a single-point play with a French name (a rouge) awarded for punts that go into the end zone without being returned.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  These differences add up to a game that is more stereotypically Canadian. It’s more civil than the N.F.L.; there are fewer concussions per team per season, perhaps because the players are generally smaller. It’s more modest in a financial sense as well: The C.F.L. salary cap is $5.15 million per team, compared with the N.F.L. salary cap of $167 million. Even the championship’s name is more humble, a Grey Cup instead of a Super Bowl. The C.F.L. has long been ahead of the N.F.L. in terms of diversity. It has been home to more than 100 black quarterbacks, double that of the N.F.L.  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The larger field promotes greater, and more chaotic, movement on the field. Three downs necessitate more passing per possession. There’s no fair-catch rule on punt returns; instead — this may be the most Canadian rule of all — defensive players must wait five yards from the receiving player until he touches the ball, which means more and longer returns. More plays are run out of a shotgun formation, and there are as many as six eligible receivers. A 20-second play clock, half the N.F.L.’s, speeds up the game. In fact, the pass-centric, no-huddle offenses now popular in the N.F.L. have long been the norm in the C.F.L.  There was an unfortunate period in the 1990s when the C.F.L. embarked on an American expansion that saw short-lived teams like the Las Vegas Posse, the Birmingham Barracudas and the Memphis Mad Dogs. C.F.L. teams were then required to dress 20 Canadian-born players — now the number is 21 — but the United States teams were exempted from that rule. The league had become too ambitious, too American. It forgot its roots as a league with uprights situated at the goal line instead of the back of the end zone; a league that, for 67 seasons, had two teams with essentially the same name (until 1996, Ottawa’s franchise was called the Rough Riders).","source":"nytamericas","date":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 09:00:02 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Letter of Recommendation: Letter of Recommendation: The Canadian Football League","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/15/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-the-canadian-football-league.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-06-15T09:06:57.146Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"594252df280b541d6b87812f"},"content":"The scientists then tried fitting all their data to various statistical models, which allowed for differing degrees of fixed behavior versus behavior that could change with age. The model that best explained the variation in their data incorporated the two, suggesting that both learning and innate personality traits had a role in influencing how cows act over time.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  On top of that, the changes in behavior that the researchers observed suggested that the elk were actually avoiding hunters. Generally, cows moved shorter distances as they aged, which probably decreased their chances of being detected by hunters. They also became better at avoiding roads, or traveling in forest or rugged terrain when close to roads, especially during dawn and dusk, when hunters were out.  Most striking to Dr. Thurfjell, older cows clearly used rugged terrain more often during bow-hunting season than rifle-hunting season.  “It’s really hard to stalk an elk in rugged terrain as a bow hunter because you need to get really close,” he said. A rifle hunter, however, can shoot into rugged terrain from hundreds of yards away.  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He suspects that, given the chance, male elk would probably learn, too. But where his group surveyed in Alberta and British Columbia, male elk are more heavily hunted, for a few reasons: They are prized more as trophies, some jurisdictions place limits on hunting females, and it’s easier to trick a bull, by mimicking the bugle call of a competitor.  In addition to being less targeted, female elk live in groups, where often only a few cows are killed at a time, providing possible opportunities for those that escape to learn what works and what doesn’t in avoiding hunters.  Farmers who want to keep elk away from their crops without decimating local populations could potentially use this dynamic, Dr. Thurfjell said, by killing just a single animal from trespassing herds, so the others learn to avoid that location in the future.  Daniel Sol Rueda, a researcher at the Center for Research on Ecology and Forestry Applications in Spain who was not involved in the study, said that the study did not fully rule out other, non-learning explanations, such as hormonal changes or social dominance leading older elk to use safer areas, .  However, the results were elegantly “suggestive of learning,” he added, and underscored the importance of better understanding how, and to what extent, animals adapt behaviorally to changes in their environment.  “The general perception is that learning is only important for humans,” he said, “but the truth is that it is crucial for many nonhuman animals.”","source":"nytamericas","date":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 09:00:18 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Trilobites: As Female Elk Age, They Learn to Evade Hunters","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/15/science/female-elk-hunters.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-06-15T09:26:55.364Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"594304ff280b543b9e878132"},"content":"“I can certainly foresee that job description being useful,” said the director Mark Wing-Davey, who as chair of the graduate acting program at N.Y.U.’s Tisch School of the Arts introduced a class this spring called Sex on Stage. Meant to give actors “confidence about boundaries and techniques” when a production asks them to simulate sex, it was taught by Mr. Wing-Davey, “partly because I’m used to staging scenes like that,” he said.  Photo  To handle the steamier moments in “Bakkhai,” the Stratford Festival hired Ms. Sina. Late in the day after the show’s first preview, with Ms. Sina there to do some fine tuning, the actresses who play the bakkhai reassembled at the Patterson Theater, a converted curling rink a couple of doors down from a hockey arena. Onstage, the red centerpiece of the set looked like a leaf topped with a raised altar — and also, at certain angles, like a stylized vulva.  Ms. Keiley is not keen on having that resemblance, which is intentional, brought up. “I don’t want people to say, ‘Oh, that’s the show with the vulva set,’” she said. Ms. Sina, who comes across as constitutionally unflappable on matters of sex, seemed by contrast to relish it, freely pointing it out.  For Ms. Sina, the task in that rehearsal was to amp up the frenzy in an unbridled scene of group ecstasy — not quite an orgy, but something like it, all in a swirl of long veils and floor-length skirts. Seeking the performers’ consent for each sensitive adjustment, and fielding sporadic requests from Ms. Keiley, who watched from the sidelines, Ms. Sina added more kisses and roaming hands, more overlapping of bodies. And maybe it would be nice to have a pelvic thrust from one woman as she straddled another?  “But not like a jack rabbit,” Ms. Sina instructed Laura Condlln, who was doing the straddling. “We actually need to isolate the pelvis.”  “Wow,” Ms. Condlln said, about to try it. “I love that everybody’s watching this. Everybody, just close your eyes for a minute.” Her colleagues laughed warmly, and kept watching.  Ms. Sina was a graduate student at Virginia Commonwealth University, studying theater pedagogy with an emphasis in movement, when she began choreographing sex scenes for student productions. “I was noticing that it was very similar to fight directing,” she recalled in an interview. “It’s just a different side of the coin, and it had to be much more specific. Every finger was important.” Her thesis, in 2006, was titled “Intimate Encounters; Staging Intimacy and Sensuality.” More recently, she started an association called Intimacy Directors International, but so far it has only a handful of members.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Her method borrows from the protocols of fight direction, with the same allegiance to keeping actors safe in potentially dangerous circumstances. “With stage combat, you can get stabbed in the eye or punched in the face,” she said. “This is emotional and mental health, which is just as important.”  Photo  The risks inherent in stage intimacy include sexual harassment and romantic entanglement. Ms. Sina said safety depended partly on clear and respectful discussion, partly on always having a third party in the room to observe any rehearsal and also on strict adherence to the choreography.  “Once they have the skeleton of the scene, then the actors can feel free to improv within the moves that I’ve given them,” Ms. Sina said. “And there’s no surprises. There’s no ‘Where is his hand going? Is he doing that on purpose? Is that him or is that the character? Do I have feelings for him now? Does he like me?’”  The Stratford Festival is Ms. Sina’s most prestigious gig thus far in a career built more on giving workshops about stage intimacy than on choreographing professional productions.  Ms. Condlln, who had done only one onstage sex scene before “Bakkhai,” said that Ms. Sina’s presence allowed the company to have “really fluid communication” about the moments of intimacy. Ms. Condlln, too, likened the practical, technical nature of the work to stage fighting, which is tightly planned even when it feels explosive to the audience.  “Inside the fight, it’s like paint by numbers,” she said. “And there’s something about Tonia’s building a vocabulary that she’s endeavoring to make the intimacy the same. So that in the throes of onstage passion, things never wander. Nobody ever gets lost along the way, and therefore everybody is safe.”  One of the most erotic moments in Ms. Keiley’s “Bakkhai” is the transformation of Pentheus, the play’s Dionysos-hating ruler, into a woman. The metamorphosis is simultaneous with Pentheus’s sexual awakening, and it culminates in an orgasm. Part of Ms. Sina’s job was helping Gordon S. Miller, who plays Pentheus, understand how to portray a woman’s orgasm.  “Tonia did a lot of vocalizations for me,” Mr. Miller said, “even recorded basically a track for me that I could follow from the get-go of how to escalate, how to use the breath — tension in the body and release.”  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Theater Newsletter Every week, stay on top of the latest news, interviews and reviews from Broadway and beyond.

Ms. Sina, whose research included watching a lot of pornography created from a female point of view, also showed the women in the cast how to express an orgasm in performance.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “That was a really, really helpful thing to do,” Ms. Keiley said. “Nobody has to bring their personal experience onstage. Nobody has to say, ‘Well, this is what I’m like in the bedroom.’ That’s very exposing, you know, asking people to improvise that stuff. You really have to be aware that that’s private.”  There is a need, Mr. Miller said, for someone with the right set of skills — and here he included both Ms. Sina and Ms. Keiley — to guide actors in performing intimacy. “Because it is going to get personal,” he added. “It’s exhausting work because it demands so much vulnerability and sensitivity, and it can be emotional.”  The method he learned from Ms. Sina will travel with him to other productions, he said, and likewise the understanding that there is a better way to handle sex scenes than leaving actors to figure them out on their own.  As for Ms. Keiley, her work on “Bakkhai” has made her vastly more comfortable talking about sex and anatomy. Still, she is not sure she’s ready to forgo using an intimacy choreographer.  “There’s a language around intimacy that would make an actor feel vulnerable, and there’s a language that will make them feel that you’re just dealing with business,” she said. “I think I’d need to learn a bit more.”  But if she were to go it alone?  “I probably would be a bit braver,” she said good-humoredly. “I can certainly stage a pretty good kiss now.”","source":"nytamericas","date":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 21:52:23 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Need to Fake an Orgasm?

The new policy was shaped in large part by Cuban-American Republicans in Congress, including Senator Marco Rubio and Mario Diaz-Balart, both of Florida, and both of whom wanted even stiffer American sanctions on the Castro government.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But many business leaders and human rights groups are profoundly opposed to the change. Even members of Mr. Trump’s own administration have privately argued that the move toward normalizing relations between Washington and Havana had yielded national security, diplomatic and economic benefits for the United States that should not be sacrificed.  The internal conflict is evident in the new approach, which will be enshrined in a policy directive that Mr. Trump plans to issue on Friday, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid pre-empting the president.  Although Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that Mr. Obama made a “bad deal” with Cuba, his shift falls well short of the wholesale reversal that many hard-liners, including Mr. Diaz-Balart, were seeking.  Embassies in Washington and Havana that reopened in 2015 for the first time in a half-century will remain open. The Trump administration is not moving to unwind other regulations that have carved out exceptions to the trade embargo, including those allowing direct financing of certain exports and allowing American dollars to be used in transactions with Cuba, the officials said.  Nor does Mr. Trump plan to restore the “wet foot, dry foot” policy that Mr. Obama ended last year, which allowed Cubans who arrived on United States soil without visas to remain in the country and gain legal residency.  Still, Mr. Trump’s expected changes are substantial.  The directive calls for reversing a rule that Mr. Obama put in place last year to allow Americans who are making educational or cultural trips to initiate their own travel to Cuba without special permission from the United States government and without a licensed tour company so long as they kept records of their activities for five years. The 2016 change punctured a major element of the American embargo against Cuba, which bars tourism.

And the Treasury Department, which will be tasked with drafting the new rules, will be directed to strictly enforce the law regarding travel to Cuba, including with routine audits.  Mr. Trump is also directing a broad prohibition against Americans doing business with companies controlled by the military, intelligence or security services in Cuba, which control of large swaths of the economy, including many foreign-owned hotels, through the military’s business arm known as Grupo de Administracion Empresarial S.A., or Gaesa. However, White House officials said there would be exceptions, including for airports and seaports, meaning that the operation of cruise ships and commercial flights would not be affected.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The current policy, officials argued, enriched the Cuban military and empowered a government that has engaged in human rights abuses. Mr. Trump’s directive will call for the State Department to issue a list of blacklisted companies to comply with the prohibition.  The Trump administration will lay out conditions that the Cuban government would have to meet before the restrictions could be lifted, including holding free and fair elections, releasing political prisoners and allowing Cuban workers to be paid directly, one White House official said.  The impending changes drew sharp criticism from architects of the Obama-era policy.  Benjamin J. Rhodes, a former deputy national security to Mr. Obama who helped broker the opening first announced in 2014, called the clampdown a politically motivated move that would ultimately be self-defeating. He said it would revive an adversarial dynamic between the United States and Cuba that would harm citizens of both countries while allowing the Castro government to once again cast Americans as the root of all its people’s ills.  “For nothing more than a partial rollback, Trump has made us the bad guy again,” Mr. Rhodes said on Thursday. “They are not going as far as the real hard line, but they are going far enough to cause damage.”  Business organizations that have been pushing Congress to lift the embargo, to foster potentially lucrative commercial relationships and closer personal and cultural ties between the United States and Cuba, also voiced opposition.  “The idea that after 55 years of failure, going back to isolationist policies will produce any results is insane,” said James Williams, the president of Engage Cuba, a pro-engagement group.  Mr. Trump plans to cast his decision on Cuba as a matter of human rights, arguing that the changes will ensure that the United States is not rewarding a government that deprives its citizens of basic rights.  “This is going to have a dampening effect, but so be it,” said Jorge Mas, the president of the Cuban American National Foundation, a Cuban exile group. “The Cuban government’s behavior has to change, and they will now understand the cost of not changing behavior.”  Human rights groups had implored the administration not to roll back the engagement policy, arguing that while the Castro government’s record continued to be poor, cutting nascent ties with Cuba would only hurt its citizens.

Ms. Porter went to Hiellen, British Columbia, to explore how the film may help revive an almost lost language and play a role in efforts by Canada to reconcile with indigenous people over past injustices.  — With the United States under the Trump administration increasingly sitting out world affairs, I looked at Canada’s efforts to distance itself from its neighbor and to lead efforts to protect the international system set up after World War II.  — In The New York Times Magazine, Mitch Moxley writes that the Canadian Football League (the current champions, the Ottawa Redblacks, play a few hundred meters from my home and office) is “like American football in the way Canada itself is like America: just similar enough to arouse what Freud called the ‘narcissism of small differences.’”  — The Stratford Festival is performing a steamy, feminist version of “Bakkhai.” How steamy?

Ruth said that Morenz had the biggest heart of any athlete he’d ever known.  Today, many visitors trek to Stratford, a city of 33,000, for its famous Shakespearean festival; others, perhaps, are pilgrims seeking Justin Bieber sites. He, like Morenz, grew up here.

Still, those monuments are here to be found. Portraits hang in the city’s arenas, and there’s a street named after Morenz. After you’ve gazed at the family house on Wellington Street, where Morenz signed his first contract, you might venture 20 minutes west, to the smaller town of Mitchell, where Morenz was born in 1902.  The wider world may have lauded Morenz as the Stratford Streak, but in his birthplace, he’ll always be the Mitchell Meteor. The arena where he played in his youth is gone, but if you stand in Morenz Park and peer north, you start to get your bearings on his story.  Photo  It helps to have Dean Robinson on hand. Mitchell-born, he’s a local historian who last fall published a new edition of his 1982 biography, “Howie Morenz: Hockey’s First Superstar.” Robinson will tell you how Morenz skipped piano lessons to play pond hockey, and show you the spot, near where Whirl Creek joins the Thames River.  “He was good when he played here, but he wasn’t yet a standout,” Robinson said. “There were a couple of other guys who were better.”  Toronto tried to sign Morenz in 1923 before Montreal secured his signature. Robinson wonders if Morenz’s mother, Rose, would have nixed his plan to turn professional if she had been alive. Just over a year earlier, Morenz, then 19, returned home from hockey to learn that his mother had drowned in a basement cistern — “ill for some time and her mind unbalanced,” a Toronto newspaper reported.  As it was, Morenz doubted his decision from the moment he made it, and tried to escape his commitment until he left for training camp. Stratford did its best to keep him, too: Local businessmen offered him $1,000 to stay.  The Morenz era in Montreal was hatched on alternative fact. Unsure how a hockey player of German descent would be received after World War I, management switched Morenz’s background to Swiss.","source":"nytamericas","date":"Sat, 17 Jun 2017 19:28:25 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Essay: Still Chasing the Stratford Streak, 80 Years After He Left the Ice","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/17/sports/hockey/howie-morenz-stratford.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-06-17T19:46:58.706Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"59458be1280b544cb3878134"},"content":"Video  We’d like to hear you sing “O Canada.”  On July 1, Canada marks its 150th birthday, commemorating the moment that a cluster of British colonial provinces joined together to form a country that quickly grew to encompass a vast expanse and array of people, languages and cultures.

Their effort is part of a movement that is sweeping countries from Australia to Argentina as aboriginals seek to assert what they see as long-ignored rights and correct centuries-old wrongs. In Canada, they have wind in their sails thanks to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s promise of reconciliation with the country’s indigenous peoples.    Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The movement has been building in Canada since the 1950s. It got a boost in 2014 with the Supreme Court of Canada’s landmark decision establishing title for the Tsilhqot’in First Nation over 1,700 square miles of British Columbia forest. Since then, dozens of land claims have been brought.  But the Innu claim is a bit unusual.  Wealthy Americans have long looked north for relaxation in the relative wilds of Canada, particularly along the pristine waterways that run south into the St. Lawrence River. And the land at issue was owned at one point by Ivers Whitney Adams, a Boston twine magnate better known for founding that city’s first professional baseball team, the Red Stockings (now the Atlanta Braves).  In the late 1800s, Adams began buying land on both sides of the river and in the end owned about a four-mile stretch, giving him ownership of not only the land, but also the river bottom, the water that ran through it and the fish in the water at any one time.  In 1875, Adams built a building on one of the banks, which still stands and serves as a communal dining room. He also set up a fishing club, which he incorporated in 1925.  Photo  Other than by deaths, there has been very little turnover in membership in the club — Camp de Peche de la Riviere Moisie, unofficially Camp Adams — since then. The roster of 10 includes eminent names like Jonathan Winthrop, a direct descendant of John Winthrop, founder of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and Gordon Gund, head of the Gund Investment Corporation and an owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team.  Donald C. Christ, 81, the club’s president, is a former senior partner at the white-shoe law firm Sullivan \u0026 Cromwell. His father was a New York Supreme Court judge.  The Innu’s traditional territory comprises most of northeastern Quebec and parts of eastern Labrador. “We never gave up our rights, sold our rights or lost a war,” Jean-Claude Therrien Pinette, the director of the land and rights protection office of Uashat Mak Mani-utenam, the Innu community at the mouth of the Moisie River, said in a phone interview.

Mr. Christ contends that “the land was never owned, if you will, in a modern sense by anybody.” He added that the club’s parcel had been acquired from various people, some of whose ancestors received grants of land from kings of France. Challenges to the ownership in the past were finally settled by the privy council of Britain’s House of Lords, he said.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But Mr. Therrien Pinette argues that the Innu claim is not ancient history, saying his grandfather fished and traveled on the river from the mouth to his northern hunting grounds. “My mother was born in 1945,” he said, “and she went to the land by canoe.”  In 1861, local Innu leaders wrote to the colonial government of the time pleading to be allowed to fish in the river. “Can our words enter into your hearts, you that govern?” they asked. “We can no more find our living; our rivers taken from us and only used by strangers. Through your will we can only now look on the waters of the rivers passing without permission to catch a fish.”  Mr. Therrien Pinette said the Innu petitioned Quebec’s Parliament last year, saying that “you’re not going to make us fish in the worse part of the river while rich Americans come to fish on the best part of the river.”  He said the Innu had asked the province to buy back the land and restore it to their people. “Then, we will welcome the rich Americans who would like to enjoy the beautiful land of my ancestors,” he said.  The province has not responded to the group’s request nor to questions for this article.  For now, Mr. Christ, who has been coming to fish for 37 years, isn’t overly worried. “I don’t think it will bring about any changes,” he said. “There are many places in Canada where people are trying to undo history.”","source":"nytamericas","date":"Sun, 18 Jun 2017 19:23:03 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Indigenous Canadians Challenge an Exclusive American Fishing Camp","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/18/world/canada/canada-indigenous-fishing-camp-quebec.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-06-18T19:46:57.616Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"59477cca280b546ac187812c"},"content":"More journalists were killed in Mexico last year than during any other year this century, and 2017 is off to an even worse start. Government critics are routinely harassed and threatened, and now they are being targeted with incredibly sophisticated software.  “The fact that the government is using high-tech surveillance against human rights defenders and journalists exposing corruption, instead of those responsible for those abuses, says a lot about who the government works for,” said Luis Fernando García, the executive director of R3D, a digital rights group in Mexico that has helped identify multiple abuses of Pegasus in Mexico. “It’s definitely not for the people.”  Photo  ‘About Getting Revenge’  Perhaps no journalist in Mexico has done as much to damage the reputation of the president than Carmen Aristegui. And few have paid as dearly for it.  In 2014, she and her team broke the scandal of the so-called Casa Blanca, or White House, a story of real estate intrigue that involved a special deal handed to Mexico’s first lady, Angélica Rivera, by a major government contractor close to the president.  The story reached a worldwide audience and forced the president’s wife to surrender the house, presenting the Mexican government with the sort of ethical quandary that in a different country might result in a congressional inquiry or the appointment of an independent prosecutor.  Instead, the president was cleared of wrongdoing by a prosecutor who had worked closely with his campaign team, while Ms. Aristegui lost her job. That moment marked the beginning of a sustained campaign of harassment and defamation against her: lawsuits, break-ins at her offices, threats to her safety and the monitoring of her movements.  “It’s been about getting revenge for the piece,” she said. “There’s really no other way to see it.”  Photo  So when she began receiving text messages in 2015 from unknown numbers, instructing her to click on a link, she was suspicious. One message asked for her help in locating a missing child. Another alerted her to sudden charge on her credit card. And she received a text message purportedly from the American Embassy about a problem with her visa. Impersonating an American government official is a possible violation of United States law.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  When the messages failed to entice her to click on the links and inadvertently download the software, they grew increasingly strident, including one warning that she could be imprisoned. Several came from the same phone number, leaving a record of the spyware operator’s sloppiness.  Still, the spyware operators pressed on. Starting as early as March, they began targeting Ms. Aristegui’s then-16-year-old son, Emilio, who was living in the United States at the time. Some of the texts were similar to the ones she had received. Others were made-up headlines about Ms. Aristegui, sent from what appeared to be a news agency.

Ms. Aristegui is the embodiment of the hope — and the crushing limitations — for a free media in Mexico. Though she was fired over what her employer called internal disagreements, she continued publishing on her own, eventually drawing enough of an audience to sustain a team of reporters.  But the work has taken its toll. In one lawsuit, filed by the president of her former employer, a judge cited Ms. Aristegui last November for her “excessive use of freedom of speech.”  Her website, Aristegui Noticias, has been hacked numerous times, including on the eve of publishing a major investigation into the massacre of more than a dozen civilians by the federal police.  And her offices were broken into last November. So brazen were the assailants that they didn’t bother wearing masks. Nor did they steal much — one computer, a watch and a bag hanging from the back of a chair. Their faces and fingerprints were captured on cameras in the office. Still, no one has been caught.  The threats, harassment, even the spying, all of it she channels into work.  “For me, I have opted to believe that my public work is what will best protect me,” she said. “The great challenge for journalists and citizens is that the fear serve us, and not conquer us.”  Photo  Texts Laced With Menace  It was Dec. 21, 2015, and Mr. Pardinas was at the beach with his family, trying to enjoy the start of his Christmas vacation. But his phone kept buzzing, at first with calls from lawyers, and then with an odd text message.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  It had been a long few months in an even longer campaign: to pass an unprecedented law forcing Mexico’s public servants to disclose their financial conflicts of interest.  In November, he had presented a study on the costs of corruption in Mexico, confirming with facts and figures something that nearly all Mexicans knew in their hearts — that corruption was crippling the country.  He followed it up with media interviews, poking fun at the Mexican government’s embarrassing response to corruption. He joked that it probably spent more money on coffee and cookies than on the office in charge of prosecuting graft.  The study, the interviews, a seemingly endless gantlet of meetings with politicians — it all laid the groundwork for the new law, which Mr. Pardinas, a private citizen directing a public policy group, was helping to write.  So even as Christmas approached and his family relaxed in the coastal town of Puerto Vallarta, Mr. Pardinas was busily consulting lawyers on the final draft, which he had just over a month to submit.  And then a message: “My father died at dawn, we are devastated, I’m sending you the details of the wake, I hope you can come.” Attached was a link.  Mr. Pardinas thought it odd that whoever had sent such a personal text was not even among the contacts in his phone. He showed his wife the message, and decided to ignore it.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Things only picked up from there, both on his proposed law and the odd messages. The government roundly ignored his bill, until he and others gathered more than 630,000 signatures supporting it.  Mr. Pardinas’s tone grew bolder. He told one radio host that “for the government of Mexico, anti-corruption measures are like garlic to a vampire.”  Then came another text message. This one appeared to be from the news outlet Uno TV, which sends daily news headlines to cellphone users across the country. The headline struck him: “The History of Corruption Within the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness.” It was particularly alarming because that was his organization.  He declined once more to click on the link, suspecting foul play. More text messages came, including the next day. Only this time, having failed with Mr. Pardinas, they tried his wife.  The message, sent from the same news headline service, said that leaked videos showed Mr. Pardinas having sexual relations with a member of his staff. It was also sent to a colleague.  Mr. Pardinas called his wife, telling her that she appeared to be part of a broader harassment effort. “Oh, it’s these people again,” she responded.  The campaign to pass the law continued, and the bill made it through Congress relatively unscathed. But the Senate decided to add an extra provision: Everyone who worked for a company that received government money would also have to disclose their interests and assets. That meant the bill would cover more than 30 million people.  The president vetoed the bill, saying it needed more discussion, essentially kicking the can down the road.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Pardinas continued his broadsides in interviews, naming obstructive lawmakers and well-connected companies that benefited from government money. Few activists go so far as to name names in interviews, but Mr. Pardinas, who holds a Ph.D. from the London School of Economics, plowed ahead anyway.  The initiative seemed doomed. Yet another message arrived, on Aug. 1, this one laced with menace: “Listen, outside of your house is a truck with two armed guys, I took their photo look at them and be careful.”  Mr. Pardinas, who was at work when this message came, once again declined to take the bait. But he did call his wife, again, asking her to look out their window to see if there was a truck parked outside. There was not.  “By the end, my wife had Olympic-style training in this hacking stuff,” Mr. Pardinas said.  Photo  ‘It Comes With the Territory’  Mario E. Patrón was on edge. The conference table was packed with fellow human rights defenders, including the United Nations commissioner for human rights in Mexico. Everyone was there to discuss the bombshell expected to drop.  An international panel brought to Mexico to investigate the haunting disappearance of 43 teaching students was releasing its final report the next day, at the end of April 2016. The findings, Mr. Patrón knew, were going to be brutal.  The government would be accused of negligence, incompetence, even malfeasance in its handling of the case. Like others in the room, Mr. Patrón, whose organization represents the parents of the missing students, was wondering how the government would respond.  His phone buzzed and he glanced at the screen. “THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO GETS OUT IN FRONT OF THE GIEI,” the text message read, using the acronym for the international panel. It seemed like the news he had been waiting for.  He showed the message to his colleague, then clicked on the link. But instead of an article or a news release, it simply redirected him to a blank page. Confused, he left the meeting and raced to his office to begin making calls to see what the government had in store.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  And like that, he fell into their trap.  Mr. Patrón is the executive director of the Miguel Augustín Pro Juárez Human Rights Center, perhaps the most highly respected human rights group in Mexico. The group focuses on the nation’s most serious cases of human rights abuses, making it a nettlesome critic of the government.  In addition to Mr. Patrón, two other lawyers for the group were targeted with the software: Santiago Aguirre, the primary lawyer representing the families of the missing students, and Stephanie E. Brewer, a Harvard-educated American lawyer who has worked for the group since 2007.  “We have always suspected they spied on us and listened to us,” Mr. Patrón said. “But to have evidence that we are victims of actual surveillance — it confirms that we are under threat. And that the government is willing to use illegal measures to try and stop us.”  Beyond the missing students, Centro Prodh, as the group is called, is representing one of the few survivors of a military raid in 2014 in the town of Tlatlaya, where the army stormed a suspected cartel hide-out and killed 22 people.  Photo  While pursuing the case, the group unearthed a memorandum ordering the soldiers to kill suspected cartel members, strengthening the argument that the events did not unfold as a firefight, as the military claimed, but were instead extrajudicial executions carried out by the soldiers.  The organization’s clients also include the women of Atenco, a group of 11 university students, activists and market vendors who were arrested by the police more than 10 years ago during protests in the town of San Salvador Atenco and brutally sexually assaulted on the way to prison.  Aside from the grave abuse of power, the case was especially sensitive: The governor who ordered the crackdown on the protesters was Enrique Peña Nieto, now the president of Mexico.  From the very beginning, the case was an uphill battle. Arrested on trumped-up charges, some of the women spent more time in prison than the officers who raped them.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Finding no recourse in Mexico, Ms. Brewer and others appealed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, a regional body outside the Mexican judicial system, to review the case. And they waited — for nearly seven years.  Finally, in 2015, the commission found in favor of the women, ordering the government to investigate the case all the way up the chain of command, a directive that would include Mr. Peña Nieto. Ultimately, the case was sent to the Inter-American Court, an independent judiciary with jurisdiction over Mexico, a major blow to the nation’s presidency.  One evening Ms. Brewer was at home, getting ready for bed when a text message arrived. The date practically coincided with the 10-year anniversary of the assaults on the women, an eerie bookend to their decade-long struggle for justice.  On her phone was a provocative question, a taunt even, asking whether anyone defended the soldiers and members of Mexico’s navy who also suffered abuse.  “And you guys that do human rights against this, what about the dignity of them …” The message contained a link, presumably to a news story or a tip.  Intrigued, Ms. Brewer clicked on it. She was directed to a broken link, a telltale sign of the malware.  “It’s just part of defending human rights in Mexico,” she said. “It comes with the territory.”","source":"nytamericas","date":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 07:00:37 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Using Texts as Lures, Government Spyware Targets Mexican Activists and Their Families","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/world/americas/mexico-spyware-anticrime.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-06-19T07:27:06.405Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"5947b062280b543f0587812f"},"content":"The University of Saskatchewan is leading the charge to become a kind of Reconciliation U, committing to change in areas including scholarship and governance, and envisioning itself as an institution of “knowledge-keeping,” as well as research and learning.  Photo  The trend has its detractors, who call it “redwash” at best and assimilation by a different name at worst. Aboriginal scholars say that colonial education philosophies and aboriginal theories of knowledge are incompatible.  “Here students are really getting developed to be trained capitalists,” said Priscilla Settee, a professor of indigenous and gender studies at the University of Saskatchewan. “We need to build curriculum that builds community and strong connections, in the context of Western development and capitalism that’s marginalized many of us.”  Even Peter Stoicheff, the university’s president, recognizes the challenges.  “Universities are so inherently white and Western, when you start to push against it, you realized how intractable a lot of that is,” Mr. Stoicheff said.  “Everything is based on reading stuff,” he explained. “Everything is laid out in a hierarchical and linear fashion. Look at the aboriginal ways, from visual expression to the wampum belt, dances and oral storytelling. It’s not linear. Everything is based on the circle.”  Supporters of the effort, though, say that no matter the challenges, or the motives, a university degree is a long-term cure for many of the insidious ills afflicting aboriginals — poverty, unemployment, addictions, poor health, incarceration, hopelessness.  Those ills, the commission found, can often be traced to the residential schools, where the government used education as a weapon of assimilation for over a century by pulling more than 150,000 aboriginal children away from their families and cultures and educating them to be Western workers. Many were physically and sexually abused.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  After the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s findings were released in 2015, universities across the country publicly vowed to close the graduation gap between mainstream Canadians and aboriginals, only 9.8 percent of whom have university degrees. By comparison, 26.5 percent of nonaboriginal Canadians have degrees.  Photo  “These are the changes the whole country needs to make,” said Blaine Favel, the former grand chief of Saskatchewan’s 74 First Nations, or indigenous groups. He was appointed the University of Saskatchewan’s chancellor in 2013 — an act of reconciliation in itself, he added.  “It hopefully will reverse and remedy the damage done by residential schools,” he said.  The University of Saskatchewan and its president seem, at first blush, unlikely candidates to lead this movement.  Mr. Stoicheff, 60, who calls himself “as white as you get,” arrived on campus in 1986 from Toronto as an English professor. He had a doctoral thesis on Ezra Pound, a passion for playing acoustic guitar and admittedly no knowledge on aboriginal issues. But he quickly learned that Saskatchewan was home to a large aboriginal population, and has festered with racial tension since Canadian troops quashed the North-West Rebellion in 1885.  Just one month into his presidency in October 2015, Mr. Stoicheff became co-chairman with Mr. Favel of the country’s first university forum on reconciliation.  “If it’s not going to be us in a province like this, leading the universities’ response to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, who is it going to be?” Mr. Stoicheff said. “If not now, when?”  The university’s existing plans to increase aboriginal student and professor numbers were bolstered, and a new focus was added for university research to be useful to aboriginal communities. Mr. Stoicheff’s mantra has become “nothing about us, without us” — something he has heard repeatedly from aboriginal communities.  Last year, the academic governing body agreed that all of the 17 colleges and schools, from dentistry to engineering, should include indigenous knowledge. Once that is added to the official Learning Charter this fall, deans will be expected to fall into compliance within one to two years, according to Patricia McDougall, vice provost of teaching and learning.  Photo  But so far, only a few new courses have been developed, including “indigenous wellness” for kinesiology students, which includes sharing circles, oral storytelling and participation in ceremonies.

To date, 4.6 percent of the university’s faculty identify themselves as First Nations, Metis or Inuit — which is high compared with the national average at universities of 1 percent, but still too small to become a tipping point and far below the province’s indigenous makeup of 16 percent.

They love the Gordon Oakes Red Bear Student Center, the campus’s new flagship aboriginal building, designed by Douglas Cardinal, an architect of Metis and Blackfoot ancestry. It opened last year as a physical symbol of the university’s commitment.  The graceful, east-facing building has quickly become the campus home for the university’s 2,830 aboriginal students, drawn by regular cultural events, from beading sessions to Monday morning smudges, a spiritual cleansing of spirit and place. The university passed an official smudging and pipe ceremony policy in 2015.  Photo  “I see the university making efforts,” said Jennifer McGillivary, 23, a single mother and nursing student who dropped out after her first year because she felt purposeless and lonely on campus, so different from her Cree reserve of Muskeg Lake.  A year later, she re-enrolled in one of the growing programs that offers first-year aboriginal arts-and-science students smaller classrooms, mentoring, flexibility and cultural activities. She graduates next year, but brought her 4-year-old daughter, Alexa, to dance in this May’s graduation powwow.

But is it really possible for a university, born from a view that all knowledge — like land — is conquerable, to deeply incorporate an aboriginal philosophy, which values nature, relationships and balance?  “Universities are intrinsically colonial,” said Mylan Tootoosis, 30, a doctoral student and co-chairman of the university’s Indigenous Graduate Students’ Council. “They are not set up for indigenous students. The way to solve indigenous problems is not getting a salary. Why not get our land back, get the indigenous lifestyle back?”  That’s a question that many aboriginal scholars are asking and that Mr. Stoicheff is open to debating.  The first residential school was opened in Canada in the 1870s, and the last, 140 miles southeast of Saskatoon, finally closed just 21 years ago. Generations of aboriginal children were stolen, and many returned broken. It will take generations of effort to address and change that legacy, Mr. Stoicheff said.  “If you can’t talk about these things at university,” he said, “where can you do it?”","source":"nytamericas","date":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 11:00:29 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"A College Built for Canadian Settlers Envisions an Indigenous Future","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/world/canada/a-college-built-for-canadian-settlers-envisions-an-indigenous-future.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-06-19T11:07:14.087Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"59489608280b547ca2878130"},"content":"Under the new restrictions, Americans will no longer be able to travel to Cuba on their own, and educational tours will be subject to strict new rules and audits.

But the move to inhibit the flow of American tourism and investment will certainly have an effect on the Cuban economy — as well as the entrepreneurs making livings in the tourism industry. Mr. Rodríguez said that kind of pressure had not succeeded in the past and would not work now.  “The measures announced will not accomplish their declared objectives, to the contrary,” he said. “These measures do not recognize the overwhelming majority opinion of the Cuban people that want to have a better relationship with the American people.”  They will have an economic impact not only in the state-owned companies, but also the cooperatives and private business owners,” he added.  Since relations have been restored and Americans have been allowed to visit, Cuba’s private sector has flourished, with new restaurants and private homes being rented on Airbnb.  Among Mr. Trump’s demands of the Cuban government was to extradite Americans fugitives living in Cuba who are wanted for crimes committed in the United States. Mr. Rodríguez threw cold water on that prospect.  “Cuba will not make concessions that harm its sovereignty,” Mr. Rodríguez said, according to The Associated Press. “We have never done that in the history of the revolution.”","source":"nytamericas","date":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 03:03:12 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Cuba’s Foreign Minister Calls Trump’s New Policy a ‘Grotesque Spectacle’","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/world/americas/cuba-trump-relations-bruno-rodriguez-vienna.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-06-20T03:27:04.079Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"5948a417280b5414c2878130"},"content":"In the same statement, the general’s staff described the meeting as a “courtesy visit” because the C.I.A. official was wrapping up a posting in Brazil.

The Brazilian Intelligence Agency, or A.B.I.N., has come under scrutiny for disclosing the identities of people vying to become agents, while Brazilian spymasters have complained about the ease with which intelligence operatives are called to appear before congressional hearings, which are televised.  “Brazil is not cut out for great power machinations,” said João Augusto de Castro Neves, a political analyst who came across the information regarding General Etchegoyen’s schedule in a newsletter and sent out a message on Twitter about his find.  “I decided to actually read the whole thing and noticed it,” said Mr. Castro Neves, Latin America director at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy.  The disclosure offered a distraction from other troubles faced by the government of President Michel Temer, who has sought to restructure Brazil’s intelligence establishment since rising to power last year after the ouster of his predecessor, Dilma Rousseff. Mr. Temer, a deeply unpopular leader, is resisting calls to resign after he was secretly recorded seeming to endorse the obstruction of anticorruption investigations.  Curiously, this may not even be the first time that a C.I.A. official’s identity has been revealed in Brazil in such a nonchalant way. The staff of the director of the Federal Police, an investigative force similar to the F.B.I., made public the names of people it said were two C.I.A. officials, including the same person at the center of this month’s disclosure, in a routine online schedule published on July 11, 2016.","source":"nytamericas","date":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 04:14:25 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Dagger, but No Cloak: Brazil’s Top Spy Exposes C.I.A.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The spyware equipment Mr. Martinelli is accused of using, Pegasus, uses malicious links in misleading text messages to infiltrate cellphones to monitor emails, contacts and text messages. Lawmakers were taped having sex. One was recorded being accused by her husband of having an extramarital affair.  Other countries are believed to have abused the spyware as well. In Mexico, at least three federal agencies have purchased about $80 million worth of spyware created by an Israeli cyberarms manufacturer.  The company that makes the software, the NSO Group, says it sells the tool exclusively to governments, with an explicit agreement that it be used only against terrorists, drug cartels and criminal groups. The advanced spyware bought by the Mexican government was used to target Mexico’s most prominent human rights defenders, journalists and anti-corruption activists, according to an investigation by The New York Times published on Monday.  “It could remotely control the microphone and the camera on certain telephone models,” Ismael Pitti, a former national security analyst in Panama who admitted participating in the scheme, said in an affidavit filed in United States District Court in Miami. “With these capabilities, we could obtain photographs and record ‘background audio,’ in other words, conversations of people close to the telephone.”  But Mr. Pitti’s former boss at the National Security Council, Ronny Rodríguez, submitted an affidavit disputing the accusations and saying that the new administration in Panama had offered him a job in Washington, D.C. if he incriminated the former president.  Because the equipment disappeared from where it had been secretly stored and used, and the server taken to Mr. Martinelli’s private office, the former president was also charged with embezzlement by misappropriation, prosecutors said.  The case also has a political back story, defense lawyers say.  The president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, had been chosen to be Mr. Martinelli’s vice president and foreign minister. Mr. Varela was from a different political party, but the ticket was meant to be a coalition government.

View all New York Times newsletters.  Mr. Martinelli said he had to fire Mr. Varela from his foreign minister post, because he was caught receiving bribes from consulates, according to court papers.  But in 2014, Mr. Varela himself won the presidency. His government began the inquiry against Mr. Martinelli, and in late 2015, ordered his arrest.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But days before a warrant was issued, Mr. Martinelli fled the country.  Mr. Martinelli was not arrested until this month, shortly after he announced his candidacy for president on Twitter. The bail hearing will take place just a day after Mr. Varela visited the White House, underscoring the political undertones the case has taken, the defense lawyers said.  “This may be the only extradition case in history where the country seeking extradition is being led by a man who is not only a political opponent of the defendant but was publicly and notoriously fired by him,” Mr. Martinelli’s lawyers, Marcos D. Jiménez and John R. Byrne, wrote in a motion filed Monday.  They argue that not only is the former president not guilty of the accusations leveled against him, but the charges are not offenses for which one can be extradited.  The extradition treaty between the United States and Panama does not cover wiretapping, because the treaty is about 100 years old and such a crime did not then exist, Panama’s vice president, Isabel Saint Malo, told the Council on Foreign Relations last year.  She also said the process could get complicated because Mr. Martinelli is a suspect in other corruption cases. If he is extradited on the surveillance case, that could prevent Panama from prosecuting him for other charges, she said.  “I believe it’s almost 10 cases that are in the Supreme Court regarding Mr. Martinelli right now,” she said to the council. “And most of them are a lot more serious than listening in to conversations, which is serious enough.”  Defense lawyers said Mr. Martinelli has immunity as a former president and as a current member of the Central American Parliament. They have proposed that he be released on $5 million bond and be allowed to remain under house arrest with electronic monitoring and 24-hour guarding of his home.  The United States Attorney’s Office submitted a motion urging the court to keep Mr. Martinelli in jail until the extradition case is decided. He faces 21 years in prison and is a flight risk, prosecutors said.  The owner of a chain of supermarkets, Mr. Martinelli has a plane and two helicopters and “has amassed an astounding amount of wealth, wealth that would facilitate an easy escape to a third country and sustain him and his family in exile for decades,” prosecutors said.","source":"nytamericas","date":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 16:46:45 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Former President of Panama Fights Extradition in Miami Court","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/20/world/americas/former-president-of-panama-fights-extradition-in-miami-court.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-06-20T17:07:00.551Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"59497258280b545f6f878133"},"content":"The police said on Tuesday that they had uncovered the collection of more than 75 artifacts outside Buenos Aires, in the suburban home of a collector whom they have not yet named.  “After investigating,” said Marcelo El Haibe, the federal police commissioner for the protection of cultural heritage, “we were able to discover those objects that were hidden behind a bookcase.

Visions of what they could do if they had the run of the place overtook them.  “I went: ‘I want the whole thing. I want the whole building,’” Ms. Lester said.  Canada has already been having a bit of a moment in New York, thanks partly to the feel-good Broadway musical “Come From Away,” about the kindness of Newfoundlanders toward stranded Americans in the days after 9/11. On Canada Day, July 1 — which this year marks the country’s 150th anniversary — Soulpepper will glide into the Signature Center on that show’s hospitable coattails, beginning four weeks of plays, musicals and concerts, as well as free cabarets in the lobby, to be hosted by Mr. Schultz. Almost all of the artists will be making their New York debuts, and most of the company is staying uptown, in City College housing.  Photo  Of the dozen ticketed productions, the three biggest will be Vern Thiessen’s “Of Human Bondage,” based on the novel by W. Somerset Maugham; “Spoon River,” a musical adapted from Edgar Lee Masters’s “Spoon River Anthology,” by Mike Ross and Mr. Schultz, and composed by Mr. Ross; and Ins Choi’s “Kim’s Convenience,” a comedy set in a Korean-Canadian mom-and-pop shop that spawned a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation sitcom of the same name, now going into its second season.  Others include “Cage,” a John Cage-inspired piece partly set in an eight-foot acrylic cube, one of many Soulpepper shows created and rehearsed with designers in the room from the start; Asha and Ravi Jain’s “A Brimful of Asha,” a comic two-hander about arranged marriage starring an Indian-Canadian artist and his mother, who is not a professional actor; and “Alligator Pie,” a musical based on the children’s poems of Dennis Lee, who is famous for them in Canada but more familiar to Americans for his work on the 1980s Jim Henson series “Fraggle Rock.”  “Every single thing that we’re taking was developed from the ground up,” Mr. Schultz said, and each piece “has a Canadian pen attached,” even if it’s an adaptation. Having such close ties to the scripts heads off performance-rights issues, but it’s also in keeping with the idea of Canadian pride, which will be on flagrant display during the Soulpepper run. The building’s Gehry connection, then, is especially apt; Ms. Lester and Mr. Schultz each pointed out the architect’s Toronto roots.  Soulpepper itself, though, is not much known outside Canada — and that is something Mr. Schultz is eager to change with this Manhattan foray. The year-round, ensemble-based company has grown immensely since 1998, when it was founded as a classical summer theater with a budget of 700,000 Canadian dollars (about $530,000 at current exchange rates) and a two-play season. Its peculiar name was the invention of Mr. Schultz’s daughter, Julia, who was 3 at the time.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  At home, Soulpepper is well established: a nonprofit with an annual budget of 12 million Canadian dollars (just over $9 million), staging about 30 shows a year and running a training program, Soulpepper Academy, whose students are paid to learn their craft. The company has branched into television, with “Kim’s Convenience,” as well as audio recordings and podcasts.  Photo  Photo  Physically, Soulpepper is looking to expand; the Young Center, its base since 2006, is now too cramped for all of its activities. When Mr. Schultz mentioned this, he mimed the feeling, rolling his shoulders and jabbing his elbows outward as if his jacket were too tight — a gesture of constriction but also of restlessness, a quality that seems built into Mr. Schultz’s constitution. In his work for Soulpepper, he is forever in pursuit of what he calls “big shiny objects,” and a new building is one of them.  Another is the Manhattan trip, which comes with the not inconsiderable price tag of 2.5 million Canadian dollars (about $1.9 million), supported by public and private donors.  “It’s a risk,” Ms. Lester said.  But it’s an investment, too, in what Mr. Schultz hopes will be “a bigger playing field of possibilities” — the international kind. More people live in California than in all of Canada, so when he says that it’s a small country, he means that everyone knows everyone there, or just about. It makes him crave a different kind of creative infusion, for himself and the company.  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He wants to work with Americans, and since the American theater is not going to come to Soulpepper, Soulpepper is going to it. The company will place itself in New York long enough, and offer a wide enough selection of its work, to give audiences and theater professionals a sense of what it does.  Mr. Schultz hopes to foster discussion, both formal and informal, with fellow artists. Ideally, new relationships will follow with theater makers he already knows by name and reputation who don’t yet know him or his company. July is meant to be an introduction.  If it works the way he dreams it will, he’ll be able to do something afterward that he can’t do now: call up any number of prominent artistic directors in the United States and simply say: “Hey, it’s Albert from Soulpepper.

Mr. Guterres told reporters on Tuesday that he would meet soon with members of Congress, including Speaker Paul D. Ryan.

After the news conference, aides said Mr. Guterres would travel to Washington next week.  The secretary general has been critical of several Trump administration moves. He said in February that its efforts to bar the citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States were both counterproductive and a violation of “our basic principles.” And he said in his remarks on Tuesday that the world’s rich countries should accept for resettlement many more refugees from the world’s war zones, including Syria.

In his complaint against Ms. Ortega, Mr. Carreño said that the attorney general had tried to “violate, threaten and undermine the fundamental principles of the Constitution” and that she acted “with a grave and inexcusable ignorance” of the country’s laws.  “She should not just be dismissed — she can and should be prosecuted,” he added.

Mr. Temer, who traveled to Russia on Tuesday, has repeatedly and vociferously denied all allegations against him. His lawyer, Antônio Mariz, dismissed the report. “The Federal Police report has no technical nor juridical value as an element of accusation,” Mr. Mariz said in a statement.  Last week, after Mr. Batista accused the president in a magazine interview of being the “boss of a criminal organization,” the president retorted that Mr. Batista was a “notorious bandit.”  Mr. Temer attacked the lax terms of Mr. Batista’s plea bargain, saying he had been given 300 months to pay back the billions he earned from corruption at subsidized interest rates.  Mr. Cortez said the real danger for Brazil was that Mr. Temer’s ambitious economic program, including an overhaul of the country’s generous pensions system, was in jeopardy. Financial markets see the changes as essential to restoring Brazil’s economic credibility, but they are strongly opposed by labor unions.  Mr. Temer’s legal troubles are the latest in a series of scandals that began in 2014 when the police unveiled a multibillion-dollar graft scheme at Petrobras.

Other than the rocky cliffs and boxy buildings, most everything is white during the long winter. On clear nights, the velvety black sky is sprayed with stars and hung with greenish garlands of ghostly northern lights.  Photo  Mr. Sakiagak set out late this winter to demonstrate how to build an igloo. He began by searching for snow that is solid, but not too dense, and is found where the wind has blown across the barren landscape interlocking the fine ice crystals into a compact stratum several feet thick.  He got off his snowmobile to test various spots, sticking a saw into the snow. He settled on a gentle slope of solid white overlooking Wakeham Bay, where a distant dog sled made its way across the flat expanse. The sky, bleached by the afternoon sun, was robin’s egg blue at the horizon, darkening to indigo directly overhead.  Mr. Sakiagak got to work, drawing a circle in the snow to mark the igloo’s perimeter. A friend, Tiisi Qisiiq, began cutting blocks of snow with a carpenter’s crosscut saw. Saws have replaced the walrus tusk knives that the Inuit favored for building igloos a generation ago.  Mr. Sakiagak laid a ring of blocks and trimmed the first few to form a ramp so that he would be building in a continuous spiral. This way, he had only one end block to worry about as the igloo rose around him. The blocks were as sturdy as Styrofoam, but heavier.  He beveled the top edge of the blocks inward so that by the third or fourth row he was laying them at a 45-degree angle to the ground. Now, with the capstone in place, Mr. Sakiagak was effectively entombed.  Martin Frobisher, the 16th-century English explorer, may have been the first European to see an igloo when he passed by during his failed search for the Northwest Passage. Since then, people have marveled at the ingenuity of the design, which incorporates principles of physics and thermodynamics to create an optimal shelter in the frozen north.  Photo  Engineers say the Inuit, through trial and error, devised a design based on a parabola, not a semicircle, eliminating the forces that would make a true hemisphere bulge and collapse. Snow is an excellent insulator, trapping air between the snowflakes, while white reflects light and heat, so most of the heat generated inside an igloo stays there.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The blocks to make the igloo were cut outside the front, leaving a trough that would serve as entryway. Mr. Sakiagak turned to digging out the igloo’s interior, leaving a platform at the original level of the surface while excavating the rest. He pushed the excess snow out of a hole that he had broken through to the trough outside. When he was done, even a tall person could stand comfortably in the room.  The coldest air settles at the door near the floor, which is below the surface of the surrounding snow outside. The warmer air, of course, rises so that the temperature around the sleeping platform, while still cold, is well above freezing and can reach 40 degrees Fahrenheit or more while it is 30 below freezing outside.

In the old days, he explained, he would cut a hole for a window, fitting a two-foot-square block of ice in the frame, to brighten the inside during the day. He and Mr. Qisiiq began filling the cracks between the blocks with slices of snow.  “These days it’s for survival,” he said. “When you go out on the land without your things and your machine breaks and you cannot reach your cabin, you can build an igloo.”  He said that only about a dozen people in Kangiqsujuaq, a town of more than 800 people, are capable of building snow houses now. “The ones who used to build igloos are too old,” Mr. Sakiagak said.  With the igloo done, he pulled his gear inside and lit a Coleman stove to boil water for tea. He and Mr. Qisiiq sat and smoked and ate some char, an Arctic cousin of the salmon, hacking pieces off the frozen fish with a hatchet and eating it raw.","source":"nytamericas","date":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 09:00:01 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Kangiqsujuaq Journal: A Lost Art in the Arctic: Igloo Making","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/21/world/canada/igloos-inuit-arctic-canada.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-06-21T09:27:09.631Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"594a5369280b54497f87812f"},"content":"Ms. Leitch did not respond to requests for comment.  The refugee, Mohamad Rafia, pleaded guilty to causing bodily harm and uttering threats. He said he did not realize that beating one’s wife was illegal in Canada, according to Abdelhaq M.

But behind the debate is a complex tale.  Mr. Rafia and his wife, Raghda Aldndal, were the subject of a sensitive and probing documentary about Canada’s Syrian refugees, produced by two Australian filmmakers last year. The film, “Canada’s Open House,” gives an unusual opportunity to look more deeply into the case.  Dawn Burke, chairwoman of the group that sponsored the Rafia family in the small town of Chipman, New Brunswick, said she used interpreters multiple times to explain Canadian laws, including those against domestic violence, to Mr. Rafia.  The larger issue that the case illustrates, said one of the filmmakers, Amos Roberts, is the difficulty that many older refugees, particularly men, face in adapting to new lives in a foreign culture. More than 40,000 Syrian refugees have settled in Canada, almost half of them sponsored privately by ordinary citizens like Ms. Burke.  “To expect new immigrants, especially refugees, to adapt within a year or two is mind-boggling,” said Professor Hamza, the interpreter.

They arrived in Chipman, and Ms. Aldndal quickly found friends, as did the children through school. But the documentary shows Mr. Rafia growing increasingly discontent and frustrated as his familial authority ebbs.  “You feel like a stranger,” Mr. Rafia said in the documentary, which was made shortly after the family’s arrival. “Guantánamo Bay is a prison on an island. It’s the same here.”  The couple’s arranged marriage was already troubled in Syria, and Mr. Rafia admitted early on that he had beaten his wife in the past, Ms. Burke said.  “We made it very clear that he was not allowed to hit his wife,” she added.  The family eventually moved to Fredericton, a city where they would be closer to a Syrian community and jobs were more plentiful. But the marriage did not improve and on May 18, Ms. Aldndal showed up at a Fredericton hospital with injuries from a beating. Mr. Rafia was arrested and pleaded guilty on May 26.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But the Allied purchase was only the beginning. Mr. Campeau next found himself battling Mr. Finkelstein for control of Federated Department Stores, the jewel of which was Bloomingdale’s. Federated’s directors favored selling the company to Macy’s, but Mr. Campeau continued to raise his bid to win over investors.  To end the bidding war, Mr. Finkelstein eventually invited Mr. Campeau to his townhouse in Manhattan. (Mr. Campeau also had a home in Manhattan, as well as one in Florida and one in Toronto.) Mr. Campeau emerged the winner, paying $6.6 billion for Federated and adding it to his empire.  He had never been a shy man; in Toronto he had been known for giving extravagant parties at the faux French chateau he built. But his ownership of Bloomingdale’s, considered the most glamorous department store in New York at the time, elevated him to a new level of fame. For a time, he and his second wife, the former Ilse Luebbert, became fixtures of New York society. Chatelaine, a Canadian women’s magazine, declared him to be one of Canada’s 10 sexiest men. (His son Daniel, then a racecar driver sponsored by the Campeau company, also made the list.)  To bring down his debt, Mr. Campeau sold off assets, including Brooks Brothers and Ann Taylor. But that proved not to be enough. By 1989, he had been forced to sell a large portion of his company for $250 million to the Reichmann family, Toronto real estate developers who were as private as Mr. Campeau was flamboyant. Early in 1990, Federated and Allied filed for bankruptcy.  (Federated later merged with Allied and rebounded and expanded in the 1990s, acquiring Macy’s, among other companies.)  Robert Joseph Antoine Campeau, one of six children, was born on Aug. 3, 1923, in Chelmsford, Ontario, a French-speaking community near Canada’s nickel mining center, to Joseph Campeau and the former Lucie Ranger.  His father was a blacksmith and mechanic who struggled to find work. The younger Mr. Campeau quit school in the eighth grade and lied about his age to take a job as a sweeper at Inco, the largest mining company in the area.  From the start, his French-Catholic background was an impediment in dealing with a Canadian business community dominated by English-speaking Protestants, he told The New York Times Magazine in 1988. By contrast, he said, he later found that the United States had “a refreshing atmosphere” in which “it doesn’t matter what your name is.”  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He took a variety of jobs there, including truck driving, and owned a corner store. He went on to build his own home, sold it for a profit and started building swaths of no-frills suburban bungalows and townhouses.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Campeau’s houses were not widely admired. Charlotte Whitton, an Ottawa mayor who frequently clashed with him over his efforts to skirt zoning rules, once said his houses made a case for nuclear annihilation.  Mr. Campeau developed a friendship with Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Canada’s former Liberal prime minister (and the father of Justin Trudeau, the current prime minister), as well as other prominent politicians. Their political opponents suggested that those relationships played a role in Mr. Campeau’s being awarded contracts to build and lease vast office complexes for an expanding Canadian federal government. Canada’s auditor general found that the government had overpaid on many of those deals.  In Toronto, Mr. Campeau pioneered redeveloping the city’s previously industrial waterfront and built some of the city’s first high-rise condominiums.  He had a complex personal life. There were several publicized bouts with mental illness. While raising three children with his first wife, the former Clauda Leroux, a textile worker, Mr. Campeau had a covert relationship and a child with Ms. Luebbert, an Austrian who later became his second wife. She lived on a farm he had bought near Montreal, about two hours from Ottawa. When the arrangement was discovered, he and his wife divorced. She died in 1980.  Mr. Campeau and his second wife separated in 1996. By then, he had transferred most of his assets to her, and after they split up, leading to a divorce, he sued her for support. A highly publicized legal struggle continued for years.  After the collapse of his department store holdings, Mr. Campeau was fired from the company that bore his name, and the Reichmanns took control. (Their business group soon failed as well.) Mr. Campeau retreated to Austria, where for many years he dabbled in real estate deals, living largely as a recluse.  It is unclear when he returned to Ottawa or when he married for a third time, to Cristal Dettman, whom he had met in Berlin during his European exile. She survives him. His other survivors include his son, Daniel; five siblings and half-siblings, and eight grandchildren.  Canadian news reports indicated that Mr. Campeau lived in rented townhouses after his return to Canada and had a relatively modest income until his divorce from Ilse Campeau was made final.  Back in his glory days, however, he dismissed any suggestions that his approach to business might prove perilous.

The America’s Cup match between Oracle and Emirates Team New Zealand could be over by Sunday if the New Zealanders, who lead 3-0, can sweep the four scheduled weekend races to win the series. The match could be extended and decided as late as June 28 if Oracle manages to improve its boat speed during this week’s five-day break. Oracle and its combative skipper, Jimmy Spithill, rallied from a much bigger deficit to defend against New Zealand in San Francisco in 2013.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “Hopefully, Jimmy can do what he did last time,” Mike Winfield, the chief executive of the America’s Cup Bermuda Development Authority, said in an interview Tuesday.  Team New Zealand appears to have more support at the cup village, where hundreds of Kiwi fans have gathered before and after races. But many Bermudans, understandably concerned with their return on investment, are in Oracle’s camp even if they are not as demonstrative as the Kiwis.  If Team New Zealand reclaims the trophy after a 14-year chase, it plans to stage the next defense at home in Auckland. If Oracle wins, there is still an outside possibility that the cup could stay in Bermuda — although Chicago, which bid for this year’s event, has continued to show interest in staging the next one on Lake Michigan, in 2019.  “Look, we’re not bright, shiny object chasers,” said Peter Durhager, chairman of the development authority. “This is about a very methodical process and what makes sense for Bermuda.”  Photo  He said he could also imagine a scenario where the cup organizers put the next match elsewhere and “the teams stay here and practice year-round and use Bermuda as a base.”  Durhager and Winfield — along with Grant Gibbons, Bermuda’s minister of economic development — were instrumental in bringing the cup to Bermuda. They initially thought Russell Coutts, Oracle’s former skipper and now head of the America’s Cup Event Authority, was using them as a stalking horse to extract better offers from American bid cities. Since the cup began in 1851, no American team had chosen to defend the trophy outside the United States.  But Coutts, a New Zealander working for Larry Ellison, Oracle’s billionaire owner, could not get the financial package he was seeking in the United States and also liked the idea of the regatta’s being the big fish in a small pond after it struggled for traction in San Francisco in 2013. Coutts and Ellison picked Bermuda, which agreed to pay $15 million as the cost of entry and underwrite a $25 million guarantee against commercial sponsorship.  Durhager expects the $25 million figure to fall to $15 million to $20 million, he said, because of an agreement allowing Bermuda to receive a certain percentage of any sponsorship it introduces.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Including capital and operational expenditures initially estimated at $40 million, Durhager puts Bermuda’s investment in the cup at $77 million, although some opposition politicians here think the figure will turn out to be significantly higher. Such an investment would be a small one for a large, developed country, but it is a big ask for an isolated British overseas territory with a population of about 65,000 and a transaction-based economy that has been in the doldrums in recent years.  So was it worth it? It will take years to know, but there will be a referendum of sorts with Bermuda’s premier, Michael Dunkley, having called a snap general election for July 18.

At a dinner last week at Bermuda’s Government House, he lobbied Coutts and the cup community to keep the event in Bermuda.  There are concerns here about “two Bermudas” and a growing gap between the largely white elite and the predominantly black lower-income population. The cup, long a magnet for tycoons like Ellison, is a playground for the elite, but the success of Bermuda’s ethnically diverse Red Bull Youth America’s Cup team, which unexpectedly reached the finals here, has generated enthusiasm across the divide in Bermuda.  So has the Endeavor program, a youth education and sailing program run by the America’s Cup that has engaged more than 1,500 students under the age of 13 in Bermuda. The program’s dinghies with pink sails have become a regular sight in the waters here.  It is uncertain whether the event will generate a longer-term uptick in youth sailing. For now, if you say “cup match” here, Bermudans still think first of the annual intra-island cricket match between Somerset and St. George’s.  What is clear is that in a country this small — only about 21 square miles — it should be easy to measure the impact of the other cup.  “We are a good petri dish,” said Durhager, who has projected $240 million in economic impact linked to the America’s Cup.  Photo  With a number of new high-end yachting facilities built for the event, Bermuda’s leaders want to attract more of the lucrative super-yacht trade as affluent sailors transit between the United States or the Caribbean and Europe.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In a pricey country ill-suited to the budget traveler, Bermuda’s leadership also wants an increase in individual tourism, arriving by flight, rather than relying predominantly on the cruise-ship trade. It wants more significant international regattas — perhaps a Volvo Ocean Race stopover — and more competitions. Durhager said the International Triathlon Union had agreed to hold several events here “on the back of the America’s Cup.”  Above all, Durhager said, he hopes the effort involved in the archipelago’s staging the biggest sports event in its history will boost Bermudans’ confidence.  “Eighteen months ago this was water,” he said proudly, as he walked around the cup village on Tuesday.  But Durhager also knows that 18 months from now, the America’s Cup could be 9,000 miles away in Auckland, perhaps never to return.

He could see it forming half a century ago in this city, where McLuhan beheld “a huge mosaic” of culture and media, a global rendezvous unlike any before. “What is happening today around the world,” McLuhan proclaimed, “is what is happening at Expo.”  Once upon a time, there really was a global village, and it was Expo 67. This pinnacle of the last century’s world expositions brought record audiences, 50 million strong, to a pair of islands in the middle of the St. Lawrence River, where they discovered a cosmopolitan panorama before the whole world fit on a hand-held screen. Innovative technologies were on display. Chic employees, mostly women, strolled past in space-age uniforms. Ambitious young architects and engineers wowed the crowds with new building types.  Photo  Most of the sites of Expo 67 are gone. The baseball team named for it moved to Washington. But 50 years later, Montreal’s museums are in the grip of Expomania, and no fewer than five exhibitions revisit the summer of 1967 and dreams of the future that could have been. This city is perpetually in festival mode, but now is an especially jubilant moment: 2017 is also the 150th anniversary of Canadian Confederation and the 375th of the founding of Montreal. This Saturday, to boot, is the Fête de la Saint-Jean-Baptiste, Quebec’s provincial holiday; if you visit, make sure you know how to order drinks in two languages.  The most engrossing of these shows is “In Search of Expo 67,” an incisive, sometimes wistful exploration of the fair and its afterlives by nearly two dozen contemporary artists, on view at the Musée d’Art Contemporain de Montréal, known as MAC. Most of the Canadians included here were not yet born when the world came to town. But they are captivated by the Expo’s lofty, humanistic rhetoric and nationalist underbelly — and while the show fits into a larger vogue in the art world for all things late ’60s, it also pulses with a tenderness toward Expo’s utopianism that makes it more than just a belated critique.  Photo  Expo happened to fall on the 100th anniversary of Canada’s leave-taking from Britain, and the fair served as the country’s international coming-out party. (A jamboree, too, for the wealthy, newly dynamic Quebec, transformed in the 1960s by its so-called révolution tranquille — and soon to be gripped by separatist zeal.) In 1967 Canadians celebrated the centenary at a pavilion shaped like a large inverted pyramid (known as Katimavik, or “meeting place,” in Inuktitut), where an artificial, abstracted maple tree was bedecked with photographs of everyday people. Today, several artists in “In Search of Expo 67” look askance at that nationalist project, including the indigenous Quebecker Geronimo Inutiq, who contributes a trippy installation that commingles videos, prints and a Katimavik-inspired dance floor. Duane Linklater, another indigenous Canadian artist in this show, has produced a new mural whose motifs — googly eyes, antlerlike tendrils — riff on the decorations of the Indians of Canada pavilion. (The 1967 wall text read, “Walk in our moccasins the trail from our past.”)  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Yet only a fraction of the pavilions at Expo 67 hosted individual nations. Private companies used them to show off new technologies; you could try out a newfangled videophone at the Bell System pavilion, which also included a cinematic projection in the round. Canada’s chemical companies put together a psychedelic Kaleidoscope pavilion, its exterior festooned with waving multicolored fins. A Christian pavilion was one of the few that broached the topic of war.  Photo  Most popular then were the thematic pavilions, with names like “Man the Explorer” or “Man in the Community,” whose exhibits fused a thoroughgoing humanism with audacious, immersive image technologies. Expo 67 was an epochal event in the history of new media — particularly for multi-projector cinema, screened for audiences who often sat on moving platforms — and several of its feats have been rebooted this summer. At the Stewart Museum, the exhibition “Expo 67 — A World of Dreams” includes a virtual reality re-creation of one of the central film experiences of the fair, the five-screen “Labyrinth.” And, at MAC, the high point of “In Search of Expo 67” is a partial re-creation of “Polar Life,” by the director Graeme Ferguson, which showcased Arctic and Antarctic landscapes against a bold modernist score across 11 screens.","source":"nytamericas","date":"Thu, 22 Jun 2017 21:29:25 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Critic's Notebook: Expo 2017: Utopia, Rebooted","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/arts/design/expo-2017-utopia-rebooted.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-06-23T11:27:20.491Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"594dbb40280b5447e087812e"},"content":"When my colleague Matt Richtel reached out to me early in March 2016 to pick my brain on the best way to talk about wildfires in the context of global warming, I knew the story to tell, one I had heard from scientists and firefighters numerous times: Fires, once confined to a season, now burn year round. The wildfires that broke out that month in Alaska and Northern Arizona, places that are usually cold and covered in snow in the winter, illustrate this point.  Wildfires are common in the late spring and early summer in the Southwest, when it is hot and dry, and also when lightning from the first monsoon storms strikes — and ignites — the parched ground. On the day the fire in Portugal turned deadly, there were at least 13 wildfires burning in Arizona. I had my eye on them, knowing what it takes for a wildfire to become news.  There are many differences between structure fires (like the recent one in London) and wildfires, and the people who fight them need entirely different training and skills. While water extinguishes flames burning a building, trails that firefighters carve in the wild — barren strips of land devoid of anything that burns — stop a wildfire.  That is a basic distinction but an important one. I learned about it while covering a wildfire that killed 19 firefighters in Yarnell, Ariz., in 2013. And it got me wanting to learn more, especially about how climate influences fire behavior.  Photo  I wrote a book about the Arizona wildfire, and while researching it I talked to a lot of scientists who study the relationship between fire and climate. I took the basic training course at the Arizona Wildfire and Incident Management Academy, where I learned to cut fire line, read the weather and work in teams.  The academy is also where I learned the right questions to ask. Last year, as a wildfire destroyed the community of Fort McMurray, in Canada, a lot of people wondered why firefighters could not stop the flames. It is a common and understandable question, since we are used to watching firefighters put out building fires within hours.  But wildfires are a different beast, and fighting them is a game of chess. It requires adaptability and patience, as does reporting on firefighting. The littlest change in weather — say, wind that starts blowing in a different direction — forces firefighters to reassess their risks and redefine their strategies, and quickly.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The point I made in the story I wrote about the Fort McMurray fire was that some wildfires grow so big and so dangerous that they simply cannot be stopped.  Fighting wildfires is backbreaking work: Firefighters work for 14 days straight, 16 hours a day, pounding the earth on rocky, steep terrain, all while carrying 50 pounds of gear on their backs. They hike for miles just to get to where they need to start digging, a place that is usually so far away and so treacherous that reporters are rarely allowed by their side. That is why we hardly see these firefighters on the evening news.  Firefighters are plagued by exhaustion. They are pressured by residents and local elected officials who want them to focus on saving homes, even if that puts their lives at greater risk. And though wildfires have changed, they are still fighting them in much the same way they have for decades.  That is a global reality, but it is only part of the story. The land is another part. The fire in Portugal showed the consequences of land abandonment over time because of changes to the social and economic order in Europe. Small farmers left rural areas for cities. Their land, which used to be heavily grazed and cultivated, was left behind with no one to care for it. Ultimately, officials said the wildfire appeared to have been arson, not an uncommon cause for wildfires, which are mostly caused by humans, intentionally or otherwise.  The Times does not have a fire beat, but I guess I’m the closest thing to a fire reporter. At home, I have my own fire-resistant shirt and pants, and the boots required to fight wildfires. In 2014, I passed a physical test that is known as a pack test — a three-mile hike in under 45 minutes with 45 pounds on my back. It is a requirement for anyone who wants to join a wildland firefighting crew.  I don’t think my family would have been thrilled if I had quit my job to go fight wildfires, so I let my certification lapse. And, to be perfectly honest, I’d rather ride waves than battle flames: The day after I worked on the story about the Portugal fire, I escaped to Maui. But if any of the editors or reporters at The Times need help on a wildfire story, I’ll be glad to help out.","source":"nytamericas","date":"Sat, 24 Jun 2017 00:45:20 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"The Times’s Resident Expert for a World on Fire","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/insider/the-timess-resident-expert-for-a-world-on-fire.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-06-24T01:07:12.212Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"594dc4a1280b5456bc87812c"},"content":"It was a vintage performance by Mr. Trudeau, similar to many I’ve reported on in the past.

Pruett, chief executive of Elevation Resources, a Texas oil and gas company. “And say, ‘Please, please get the Trump administration to back off of the Nafta cancellation rhetoric and enable us to continue to have the economic boom that natural gas has created for Texas.’”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mr. Trump has threatened to terminate unless he can get a “fair deal” for the United States, the authorization of natural gas exports is virtually automatic.  But if the United States pulls out of the agreement, it will be up to the Energy Department to approve future gas exports considered to be in the national interest.  That places Mr. Perry in a pivotal role at a tense time, and there is good reason to consider him a friend of the industry. As governor of Texas, he defended contentious practices like fracking to promote his state’s oil production and natural gas exports. Under his watch, production of natural gas in the state soared 50 percent.  After he left office, Mr. Perry joined the board of Energy Transfer Partners, a company that has completed four gas pipelines to Mexico in the last two years.  And when he ran for president in 2016, the company’s chief executive became the single biggest contributor to Mr. Perry’s ill-fated campaign.  Kelcy Warren, Energy Transfer’s chief executive, donated more than $6 million of the $16.7 million raised by the 2016 Perry presidential campaign, according to Federal Election Commission data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Most of the money was then returned to Mr. Warren when Mr. Perry dropped out of the race.  “Rick Perry is a really good friend of mine and he is a bright guy,” Mr. Warren said. “He understands the energy business quite well, and it gives me great comfort that he is in that position.”  Last month, the Trump administration gave Congress official notice that it planned to renegotiate Nafta, a pact that the president has called “the worst trade deal ever.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Then this month, the American Petroleum Institute, one of the strongest lobbies in Washington, made its position unmistakably clear in an open letter to the administration stating that “the current NAFTA agreement works for the oil and gas industry.”  Photo  Mr. Perry says he understands the symbiotic nature of the relationship between Mexico and American energy companies, and he has promised to do what he can to maintain it. Even in the unlikely event that Nafta could not be renegotiated, he said, he would fully support continuing the energy trade.  “I see this as an opportunity to allow an American natural resource to help bolster both countries’ economies,” he said. “The overall goal of the Trump administration is to sell what Americans make to bolster this economy. If you are selling it to a partner, a neighbor, even better.”  Mr. Perry said his stance was not clouded by his former job on the board of Energy Transfer. Having already passed through the revolving door between government and the energy industry, Mr. Perry said, he was in no way conflicted about his new role.

Mr. Trump’s threats against Mexico and shifting statements about withdrawing from Nafta have prompted some worry, however, persuading Mexican officials to begin exploring options in the event of a cutoff.  “In the context of an escalating trade war, a cutoff of gas by one side or the other is possible,” said Kevin Book, managing director of ClearView Energy Partners, an energy research firm.  Such a move, according to Mr. Book, would summon what he calls a “mutually assured destruction scenario,” in which American companies suffer a serious loss of income and Mexico faces an energy shortage that could devastate the most basic functions of its mega-capital, Mexico City.  The impact on the United States could also hit home for some of the most important members of Mr. Trump’s cabinet and support base. With American gas exports to Mexico expected to double by 2019, most gas will come from Texas, a vital Republican stronghold that is the home state of both Mr. Perry and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson.  Mr. Trump’s threats have “created some worry on Mexico’s part, and as a result Mexico has looked at its backups and alternatives,” said Carlos Pascual, the former American ambassador to Mexico and a senior vice president for IHS Global Energy. “But the first screams that would go up if the U.S. were to cut off natural gas shipments to Mexico would come from the oil and gas producers in Texas.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  At least 17 pipelines currently carry more than four billion cubic feet of natural gas a day to Mexico, with four additional cross-border pipelines to be completed over the next two years and many more in the planning phase.  Expanding natural gas sales to Mexico has become increasingly important because the glut of production in the United States far exceeds domestic demand. In short, to keep the price of natural gas from collapsing, American producers need Mexico, their largest customer.  For Mexico, natural gas is a linchpin of its future. It will become the major source of the nation’s power in the next decade, a crucial resource to generate electricity for citizens and industries. Mexico’s Energy Ministry announced a five-year plan in 2015 to expand the country’s pipeline network to accommodate increased imports of gas.  With American natural gas both cheap and readily available, Mexican oil executives have set aside plans to produce their own gas from their country’s shale fields. That has left some worried that if the trade relationship falters, Mexico could suddenly be on shaky ground. Mexican officials have begun to explore importing liquid natural gas from countries like Peru.  Publicly, however, officials and executives in Mexico have been cautiously optimistic about the future of the energy trade. In an appearance at Rice University last month, José Antonio González, chief executive of the national oil company Petróleos Mexicanos, said he felt confident that Mr. Trump’s trade policies would not interrupt the flow of oil and gas between the nations.  “Trade is a win-win, especially in energy,” he said with a smile. “In the case of Mexico and United States it is clearly complementary.”  Mr. Perry largely agreed, acknowledging the importance of the natural gas trade to American companies and their efforts to protect it.  “Everybody in the private sector is going to look after their interests and their stockholders’ interests. I get that, and that’s fine and good,” he said. “The Trump administration is going to make decisions on how to sell American products, create American jobs, and if that helps bolster the relationship with Mexico and Canada in a North America energy strategy, then there is a lot of reason to celebrate.”","source":"nytamericas","date":"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 09:00:23 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Trump’s Anti-Nafta Stance Is on a Collision Course with Natural Gas","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/world/americas/rick-perry-mexico-gas-energy-industry-electricity-natural-gas.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-06-26T09:07:24.042Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"59519854280b54071987812d"},"content":"Photo  Times Insider shares insights into how we work at The New York Times. In this piece, the photographer Federico Rios Escobar explains how he drew a particularly large subject out of her proverbial shell at a recent (and spontaneous) shoot for a Travel section cover story on the Galápagos Islands.  The slowness of the tortoise was proportional to the patience of the photographer. I approached with caution and kept my distance, to avoid causing either of us stress. The last thing I wanted was to slip and find myself — or my camera — flattened under one of those monumental animals. With even minimal intimidation, they would hide in their shells and not move for a long time. It was a great test of will.  On the last day of my assignment in the Galápagos, I noticed a couple of tortoises on the road that leads from Puerto Ayora to the airport. I asked my driver to stop the car so I could get out, and I watched one of them slowly advance on the sidewalk as cars and buses passed by. At the sound of each vehicle, the tortoise attempted to hide her head and take refuge. I quietly crouched down next to her. After a while, the tortoise acknowledged me. She knew I was there, lying on the ground in front of her with only a few meters between us, and she no longer seemed to mind my presence. Gradually she started moving again, slowly and heavily. When I finally had the photo I wanted, I got on my feet and found my driver smoking a cigarette outside the car. I had been lying there on the ground for almost 40 minutes without realizing the passage of time, while the tortoise barely moved a few meters. It was an intimate encounter, a special connection, just the tortoise and me, alone. A state of suspended consciousness in which there was no need to rush.  Back in the car, we hit the accelerator hard since it was only minutes before my flight took off. When I arrived at the airport, I sped through the waiting room to the gate. In front of me were the stairs to the plane, empty now. I was the last passenger to board, just seconds from being left behind. I approached with a furiously beating heart, sad to leave the Galápagos and my meditation with the tortoises.

In papers filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, a lawyer for Haitian victims challenged a request for dismissal of his case by the Justice Department, which acted on behalf of the United Nations.  The arguments by the lawyer, James F. Haggerty, differed from those in a separate lawsuit filed by the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, an advocacy group, which argued that the United Nations had failed to give victims a way to settle their grievances. A federal appeals court dismissed that suit last August at the Justice Department’s request.  The Justice Department has until July 7 to respond to Mr. Haggerty’s filing, which argues that the United Nations established as far back as the 1990s that it was legally liable for damages caused by negligence from peacekeeping operations.  Acceptance of that liability, Mr. Haggerty said, was the same as waiving immunity under the treaty the United Nations has invoked as protection, known as the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations.

That treaty, he said, “should not be a shield to hide behind because the United Nations (or the U.S. government) doesn’t like the price tag that comes with the U.N.’s indisputable gross negligence in this case.”  United Nations officials indicated on Monday that they expected Mr. Haggerty’s lawsuit to be dismissed as well. “Our legal position remains the same,” said Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesman for Mr. Guterres. “Our focus is on combating cholera and assisting impacted communities.”  Roughly 10,000 Haitians have died and nearly a million have been sickened since cholera was introduced into Haiti in 2010 by infected United Nations peacekeepers from Nepal. Studies showed the cholera bacteria came from poor sanitation by the peacekeepers.  The United Nations never acknowledged it was at fault, and even when Mr. Ban apologized last December for its failure, he worded the apology to avoid any mention of who had brought the cholera to Haiti, the Western Hemisphere’s poorest country.

Elections are looming next year, and many lawmakers are facing their own corruption investigations. They may well feel safer siding with the government, even one as shaky as Mr. Temer’s, said Marcus Melo, a professor of political science at the Federal University of Pernambuco.  “He is a lame duck, but incredible as it sounds, he can count on this base because they, too, are implicated in many things,” Mr. Melo said.  But if the prosecutor general does bring separate charges against Mr. Temer, each one will have to be voted on separately, said Roberto Dias, a professor of constitutional law at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in São Paulo.  “The tendency is that each time there is an indictment offered, that the political support that Temer has will be reduced,” he said.  None of this bodes well for Mr. Temer’s legislative agenda, an ambitious package of austerity measures that he says is needed to revive Brazil’s economy.  Financial markets regard the measures, which include an unpopular overhaul of Brazil’s generous pension system, as crucial to restoring the country’s battered fiscal credibility.  So does Mr. Temer, as he made clear on Monday, before the widely anticipated charges were revealed. “There is no Plan B. We have to keep going,” he said. “Nothing will destroy us. Not me nor our ministers.” He has vehemently denied all of the accusations against him, and has often pointed out that Mr. Batista received a generous plea bargain in exchange for cooperating with prosecutors.  The president did not immediately comment on the charges. Yet the constant flow of allegations has made it difficult for the government to operate, let alone carry out far-reaching plans.

On Monday, a federal police report said there were indications that Mr. Temer had obstructed justice in apparently encouraging Mr. Batista to keep making payments to Eduardo Cunha, the former speaker of the lower house of Congress, who has been jailed in a separate corruption case. This could mean a separate charge against the president.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Executives at JBS, a Batista company, testified that Mr. Temer had negotiated millions of dollars in illegal campaign donations for his Brazilian Democratic Movement Party. In a separate case, he faces scrutiny over claims that he negotiated a $40 million bribe for the party in 2010.  But so far, Mr. Temer has been able to escape those and other allegations.  This month, he and his predecessor, Dilma Rousseff, whom he served as vice president before taking part in successful efforts to oust her, were cleared by an electoral court on charges of violating campaign finance laws during their 2014 campaign.  Mr. Temer will need 172 federal deputies to either abstain from voting or vote against accepting the charge brought by Mr. Janot.  Sylvio Costa, the founder of Congress in Focus, an independent monitoring site, said the president’s support was weakening. He said it could be further compromised if there were more revelations, or any sign that Brazil’s economy, which has been showing some faint signs of recovery, is stumbling again.  Mr. Temer can count on around 200 to 250 of the 512 deputies in the lower house, compared with about 400 a year ago, Mr. Costa said.  A poll released last weekend found that 7 percent of Brazilians approved of Mr. Temer’s administration, 76 percent thought he should resign, and 47 percent felt ashamed to be Brazilian.  Datafolha, the polling company, interviewed 2,771 people in 194 cities from June 21 to 23. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points.  A visit by Mr. Temer to Russia and Norway last week, intended to distract from his problems at home, seemed to make them worse.  First, his itinerary announced that he would be visiting the Soviet Union. Then the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, told him that Brazil needed to address its corruption problem, and Norway halved its contribution to an Amazon rain forest fund because deforestation was increasing.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story  A Different Kind of Identity  In other Western countries, right-wing populism has emerged as a politics of us-versus-them. It pits members of white majorities against immigrants and minorities, driven by a sense that cohesive national identities are under threat. In France, for instance, it is common to hear that immigration dilutes French identity, and that allowing minority groups to keep their own cultures erodes vital elements of Frenchness.  Identity works differently in Canada. Both whites and nonwhites see Canadian identity as something that not only can accommodate outsiders, but is enhanced by the inclusion of many different kinds of people.  Canada is a mosaic rather than a melting pot, several people told me — a place that celebrates different backgrounds rather than demanding assimilation.  “Lots of immigrants, they come with their culture, and Canadians like that,” said Ilya Bolotine, an information technology worker from Russia, whom I met at a large park on the Lake Ontario waterfront. “They like variety. They like diversity.”  Identity rarely works this way. Around the world, people tend to identify with their race, religion or at least language. Even in the United States, an immigrant nation, politics have long clustered around demographic in-groups.  Canada’s multicultural identity is largely the result of political maneuvering.  Photo  In 1971, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau faced a crisis amid the rise of French Canadian separatism in Quebec. His party was losing support, and his country seemed at risk of splitting in two.  Mr. Trudeau’s solution was a policy of official multiculturalism and widespread immigration. This would resolve the conflict over whether Canadian identity was more Anglophone or Francophone — it would be neither, with a range of diversity wide enough to trivialize the old divisions.  It would also provide a base of immigrant voters to shore up Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal Party.  Then, in the early 2000s, another politician’s shrewd calculation changed the dynamics of ethnic politics, cementing multiculturalism across all parties.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Jason Kenney, then a Conservative member of Parliament, convinced Prime Minister Stephen Harper that the party should court immigrants, who — thanks to Mr. Trudeau’s efforts — had long backed the Liberal Party.  “I said the only way we’d ever build a governing coalition was with the support of new Canadians, given changing demography,” Mr. Kenney said.  He succeeded. In the 2011 and 2015 elections, the Conservatives won a higher share of the vote among immigrants than it did among native-born citizens.  The result is a broad political consensus around immigrants’ place in Canada’s national identity.  That creates a virtuous cycle. All parties rely on and compete for minority voters, so none has an incentive to cater to anti-immigrant backlash. That, in turn, keeps anti-immigrant sentiment from becoming a point of political conflict, which makes it less important to voters.  In Britain, among white voters who say they want less immigration, about 40 percent also say that limiting immigration is the most important issue to them. In the United States, that figure is about 20 percent. In Canada, according to a 2011 study, it was only 0.34 percent.  Courting Ethnic Groups  Even as politicians engineered a pro-diversity consensus, immigrant and minority groups have organized, unapologetic about asserting their interests.  In Canada, because all parties compete for all ethnic blocs, minorities do not tend to polarize into just one party. That leaves little incentive for tribalism, even as minority groups feel empowered to champion their ethnic or religious identity.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “We say, ‘Look, where do you stand on particular issues of importance to us?’” said Kulvir Singh Gill, a member of Toronto’s powerful Sikh community. “And on the basis of that, we’ll be selective in our support.”  This month, Mr. Gill helped organize a fund-raiser dinner for Seva Food Bank, a Sikh-led charity he co-founded.  The event was crawling with politicians. Senior members of Canada’s three main parties were present, as were several members of Parliament and the provincial premier, Ontario’s equivalent of governor. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Pierre Trudeau’s son) had recorded a video to open the dinner.  All were seeking support from Canada’s Sikhs — but all were going to have to work for it.  Mr. Gill attributed this to “a real maturation in the community,” with Sikhs cultivating ties to all three parties, ensuring that the Sikh voice would be represented no matter who holds office.

View all New York Times newsletters.  Other minority groups have pursued this strategy, too. As a result, while minorities in other countries feel pressure to assimilate, in Canada they do best when they retain a strong group identity.  Political science research suggests that this dynamic may have also made Canada resistant to political extremism and the polarization plaguing other Western countries.  Lilliana Mason, a professor at the University of Maryland, has found that when group identity and partisan identity overlaps, that deepens partisan polarization and intolerance against the opposing party.  But because Canadian politics accounts for diversity without polarizing across ethnic or religious lines, it is more resilient. Everyone, including whites, becomes less likely to see politics as a game of us versus them.  “We’re an articulation of that Canadian dream, the Sikh Canadian dream, of living our values and putting them into action,” Mr. Gill said.  Photo  Making Mass Immigration Work  Rapid changes in demographics tend to spur anti-immigrant sentiment within the dominant group, experts say, bolstering far-right politicians who promise harsh tactics against outsiders.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But although Canada’s high immigration rates have transformed the country in just a few decades, the public has mostly been calm and accepting.  One reason may be Canada’s unusual immigration policies. A sponsorship system, in which Canadian families host newcomers, allows communities to feel they are a part of the country’s refugee resettlement program.  And a points system, which favors migrants who are thought to contribute economically, makes immigration feel like something that benefits everyone.  As a result, immigration is broadly accepted as positive, closing off a major avenue of populist mobilization.  Ahmed Hussen, the federal immigration minister, said “the luck of geography” had also helped make immigration feel less threatening.  Virtually every immigrant to Canada is brought here deliberately. Research suggests that uncontrolled immigration, for example the mass arrival of refugees in Europe, can trigger a populist backlash, regardless of whether those arrivals pose a threat.  “We have the luxury of being surrounded by oceans on three sides, and then by the U.S. border,” Mr. Hussen said. “Which, relative to your southern border, doesn’t have the same amount of irregular migration.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Immo Fritsche, a professor at the University of Leipzig, in Germany, has found that when people feel a loss of control, they cling more closely to racial and national identities. And they desire leaders who promise to reassert control.  European populists have run on such promises, and by accusing political establishments of selling out their countries to migrants. President Trump’s promise to build a border wall is, at its core, a promise of control.  But Canada’s points- and sponsorship-based systems, along with its geographic position, help communities feel a sense of control over immigration so that, even as new arrivals change politics and society, backlash has been minimal.  The Face of Canadian Populism  The result is a system tilted heavily against populist outsiders.  Photo  Although some have found local success, particularly in Quebec, they have not managed to get national traction. At the end of my time in Toronto, I attended a conference held by The Rebel, an online news media channel that is often called “Breitbart North” and once seemed like Canada’s populist vanguard.  Like the American outlet Breitbart News, it has risen on dark warnings about Shariah law and nefarious elites.  Last year, as the populist wave rose worldwide, The Rebel threw tacit support to a handful of politicians. One, Kellie Leitch, received airtime and praise as she sought to push populism into the mainstream.  But this year, when Ms. Leitch ran for the leadership of the Conservative Party, a major test of populism’s appeal in Canada, she won less than 8 percent of the vote, placing sixth.  When I attended The Rebel’s daylong conference in Toronto, I saw no politicians drumming up support — a sharp contrast to the Seva gala the night before.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Tara Cox, a yoga teacher, said she had some concerns about Shariah law, but quickly added that “a Syrian family moved to our small town, and everyone has rallied around them.”  When a speaker warned of Muslim no-go zones in “every hamlet, every village” in Britain, saying that the same could happen in Canada, there were no bellows of rage from the audience, only courteous murmurs of concern.  This was the face of Canadian populism. As their counterparts fan out across Europe and the United States, flexing their political muscle against frightened establishments, here was a listless, modestly sized crowd, whose members seemed aware that they had underperformed but unable to explain why.","source":"nytamericas","date":"Tue, 27 Jun 2017 07:00:31 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"The Interpreter: Canada’s Secret to Resisting the West’s Populist Wave","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/world/canada/canadas-secret-to-resisting-the-wests-populist-wave.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-06-27T07:07:36.374Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"595261ef280b545240878131"},"content":"Photo  The first time could have been chalked up to charming idiosyncrasy. The second time, it seemed like an effort to bring some levity to a complicated situation. But the third and fourth (and fifth and so on) times that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada wore themed socks on a public occasion, it seemed clear that something more calculated was going on.  You’ve heard of fashion diplomacy, or frock diplomacy? The practice whereby a female politician, or the wife of a world leader, uses clothing to convey unspoken messages about a platform or position or as a form of outreach?  Well, this is clearly sock diplomacy. It’s a new tactic in the political playbook.  And it reached an apogee of sorts on Sunday, when Mr. Trudeau marched in Toronto’s Gay Pride Parade wearing a rainbow-striped pair printed with the words “Eid Mubarak” in recognition of the holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, and which coincided with this year’s parade. Yes: He honored two communities with one pair of socks. And he supported local industry: They were made by a Toronto-based company, Halal Socks, and cost $14.99. All that doesn’t happen by accident.  It also followed closely on an appearance in regular rainbow socks for a Pride flag-raising on June 14 in Ottawa, and one on the syndicated TV show “Live with Kelly and Ryan” on June 5 in patriotic maple leaf socks — which he also wore in 2015 at a gathering of Canada’s provincial heads of government.  Photo  There was another smart socks show in May during a NATO meeting in Brussels, when Mr. Trudeau wore one blue sock and one pink, each with the NATO flag emblazoned on the side.  And that followed his much documented meeting with Enda Kenny, then the prime minister of Ireland, to which he wore “Star Wars” socks (it was International “Star Wars” Day). I could go on, but you get the idea.

To see it herself as a black Quebecer, she said, was “seeing a representation of what is too often your actual place in society.”  Ms. Nicolas, whose group is pressing the provincial government to investigate systemic racism, said the fact that the organizers did not notice what she called the float’s blatant symbolism, intentional or not, shows that “systemic racism is alive and well in Canada.”  The young men who pushed the float were members of a local high school sports team who had volunteered to do the job. Mr. Brouillet, whose video had been viewed more than 1.8 million times on Facebook through Tuesday afternoon, said he regretted that the athletes had been dragged into the controversy.

Of all of Canada’s provinces and territories, Quebec stands out for its nationalism, tied to a separatist movement and a centuries-long feud with country’s dominant Anglophone community that dates to the Treaty of Paris in 1763, when France ceded what was then called New France to the British. Slavery was a part of the province’s life for 200 years, as it was elsewhere in Canada, affecting both black and indigenous peoples; it was abolished in most of the British Empire, including Canada, in 1833.","source":"nytamericas","date":"Tue, 27 Jun 2017 19:42:37 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Montreal Parade, Usually a Point of Pride, Raises Debate About Racism","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/world/canada/montreal-quebec-parade-racism.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-06-27T19:55:24.135Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"5952c63b280b546d89628a9e"},"content":"Photo  TORONTO — President Trump’s brand will no longer tower over Toronto.

And the FARC is laying plans to become a political party, much like the parties that emerged from guerrilla groups in post-conflict El Salvador and Guatemala.  The Colombian government must now tackle a host of challenges under the complicated peace agreement with the FARC, which took years to negotiate. Special tribunals are to be established to settle war-crimes cases, and farmers are to be given incentives to stop growing coca leaf. (The rebels largely controlled the cocaine trade in Colombia.)  “The goal of ending the war has essentially been met,” said Cynthia J. Arnson, the director of the Latin America program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. “It’s implementing the 300-plus-page document, with 100 different programs and strategies, that’s going to be difficult.”  Colombia’s president, Juan Manuel Santos, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year for the peace accords with the FARC, but the deal remains highly controversial in Colombia. Voters rejected the accords by a narrow margin in a referendum last year, with many Colombians arguing that the fighters, who were promised amnesty, had gotten off too easily.  After the referendum, Mr. Santos got the Colombian Congress to approve a revised deal with FARC without submitting it to another referendum. But with his term scheduled to end next year, he has been under constant attack from conservatives, including critics who say that the FARC will not reveal all the weapons and cash it has hidden in the jungle, something analysts say is possible.  The ceremony on Tuesday offered Mr. Santos a chance to remind his country that peace with the FARC had been awaited by generations of Colombians.  “This is the best news for Colombia in 50 years — this is great news of peace,” he said, adding that the country could now finally unify as a democracy. “Today we see the end of this absurd war.”  Photo  At the FARC camp, in the Putumayo department of southern Colombia, about 460 fighters now spend their days contemplating the unarmed life ahead of them.

She said it was hard for her, as an orphan, to give up the protection of her weapon and her comrades.  “For every guerrilla fighter, their weapon has always been their most loyal friend, which has always accompanied them,” she said. “Some people have names for their rifle.”  Like many of the rebels, Ms. López is afraid of what might happen now that the former guerrillas must depend on the state for protection. She mentioned the last time the FARC experimented with political participation, running candidates for office under the Patriotic Union party banner, only to face massacres by right-wing paramilitary groups that the government failed to stop. Those groups still exist.  “They could kill us one by one,” Ms. López said.  The rebels have found consolation and warmth in visits to the camp by loved ones they have not seen in years.

He was imprisoned but was later released pending trial and fled to the United States before he could be convicted.

With such extensive documentation, and almost certain imprisonment if he was deported back to Venezuela, Mr. Coello expected a relatively easy path to asylum.

But since President Trump’s inauguration in January, ICE agents have taken a more active approach to immigration enforcement, arresting more people and in particular, more people without serious criminal convictions.  Mr. Coello was working as a driver for the ride-hailing service Lyft last year when he became drowsy and pulled over to sleep in a parking lot. He received a ticket for trespassing by a police officer and later paid a $100 fine and $92 in court costs.  A spokesman for ICE said the trespassing violated the terms of Mr. Coello’s stay in the United States, leading to his arrest when he showed up for an asylum interview.  Mr. Coello’s case drew extensive media coverage in Florida and back home in Venezuela. To many in South Florida, which has a large community of residents who fled socialist governments in Cuba and Venezuela, ICE appeared to be acting overzealously. A day after Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, intervened in the case, Mr. Coello was released from a Miami-area detention center.  With the situation deteriorating at home, more Venezuelans have filed asylum petitions in the United States than any other nationality during the fiscal year, according to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, which handles asylum cases.","source":"nytamericas","date":"Wed, 28 Jun 2017 21:41:04 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Torture Victim Seeking Asylum in U.S. Will Not Be Deported","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/28/us/venezuelan-torture-deport.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-06-28T22:04:17.984Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"5954521740fc562d9a1f66b2"},"content":"“I wanted to cry,” said Vanessa Furtado, a 46-year-old swimming teacher, who saw the helicopter arrive and its occupants wave their banner — and for a moment thought the security forces were taking the side of protesters.

But there were no signs of the attackers.  The event underscored the frustrated nature of Venezuela’s protest movement, which has continued unabated since April. Sustained unrest has left more than 70 people dead, mobilized crowds of thousands daily and militarized the country under the National Guard, resulting in even more instability than before.  President Nicolás Maduro, the target of the protesters’ ire, has responded with a steady stream of repressive actions, ordering the security forces to shoot at crowds with rubber bullets and rounding up hundreds to be sent to military tribunals. But unlike the leaders of Egypt or Turkey, Mr. Maduro has not yet ordered the kind of crackdown that could crush the opposition.  The protesters have drawn hundreds of thousands of supporters, shutting down streets and paralyzing Caracas, the capital, with regularity. But while demonstrators in Ukraine, at the height of their uprising, toppled their government in a matter of days, Venezuelans confront a president who is simply digging in.  The narrative of rogue security forces in a helicopter offered another approach: armed revolt from within. But for now, that does not seem to be a viable path.  “My sense is what happened yesterday was so bizarre that most Venezuelans don’t know what to make of it or know who to blame,” said David Smilde, an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights group. “Venezuelans in general don’t respond positively to military coups.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Recent history has offered examples. In 1992, Hugo Chávez, then an army lieutenant, joined fellow officers in an uprising that was crushed by other military forces, and Mr. Chávez was jailed. Six years later, he turned to democratic means to gain power, winning the presidency.  In 2002, members of the military who opposed Mr. Chávez’s changes deposed him for a brief period and a new president was installed. But Venezuelans who supported Mr. Chávez took to the streets, and he was quickly reinstalled.  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The helicopter attack was just one example this week of the country’s strained institutions fighting each other.  On Wednesday, the Supreme Court barred Luisa Ortega, the attorney general who opposes Mr. Maduro, from leaving the country and froze her bank accounts. The court said it had done so because it was investigating her for misconduct, a process that could lead to her removal from office.  “There’s an attempt to nullify the office of the attorney general,” Ms. Ortega said at a news conference on Wednesday before the announcement. “We have lost the right to protest; they judge civilians in military courts, raid homes with no warrants.”  Members of the National Guard spent much of Tuesday blocking the entrance to the National Assembly, which is controlled by Mr. Maduro’s opponents.  In a video circulated online, Julio Borges, the assembly speaker, can be seen engaged in a heated argument with a National Guard commander who is blocking a door. The commander aggressively shoves the lawmaker out of the doorway, and Mr. Borges nearly falls.  But those who saw the helicopter attack on Tuesday were still expressing bewilderment about what had happened.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Ms. Furtado, the swimming teacher, recalled that she saw tears in the eyes of many who were there.  “A woman started to cry and got on her knees and said: ‘Now the powers that be are with us, with the people. It might end right now for all of us,’ ” she said.  But the attack appeared to have been carried out by rogue security personnel with no visible support in the military. A video posted that day showed a uniformed man named Oscar Pérez, flanked by heavily armed men, taking responsibility for the attack and urging more action.  Yet doubts about the attackers’ motives are surfacing. Cliver Alcalá, a former general who now opposes Mr. Maduro, said it was impossible to believe that the attack could have been launched by dissidents.  “It’s not conceivable that someone with a helicopter could take off and attack the government with a grenade — it just doesn’t make sense,” Mr. Alcalá said. He said he suspected that Mr. Maduro might have been complicit in the attack, seeking to use it as proof that his opponents had resorted to terrorism.  Others felt the rogue officers had good intentions. “I think he was a brave man,” Daniela Díaz, a 31-year-old dentist in the capital, said of Mr. Pérez.  But Ms. Díaz admitted that she found the strategy a bit odd.  “I think it was all very strange, the bombs, and so on,” she said, “but if you ask me now, I think it was for real, and if it’s a question of supporting them, then we would support them.”","source":"nytamericas","date":"Thu, 29 Jun 2017 00:47:26 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"After Helicopter Attack, Venezuelans Ask, What Was That About?","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/28/world/americas/venezuela-nicolas-maduro-supreme-court-helicopter-attack.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-06-29T01:04:23.720Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"5954521a40fc562d9a1f66b3"},"content":"A rogue police force attacked Venezuela's Supreme Court in Caracas by helicopter on Tuesday, amid protests against the government and the economic crisis.

Even though the kids spent pretty much every summer and Christmas in Canada, visiting relatives and canoeing in the wilderness or doing other activities that required tractors and involved antler treasure hunts, the country was to them almost an abstract concept representing nature, escape, space and good manners, rather than an electoral identity.

The burgundy of the European Union book seemed like a relic of another time.  “Will we have to get a new passport?” one asked. “What if I don’t want to be English?” another said. Their fondest memories, it turned out, were of the free flow across borders — of the speed of belonging rightfully in the E.U. line at Heathrow Airport, and being able to move from culture to culture without being labeled an “alien.”  The bedtime story of the American dream and the European Union that had held such an enlightened allure suddenly seemed like perhaps a pipe dream, and the Canadian dream — of what Justin Trudeau called a “postnational state” — took on the halo of recognition. As did Mr. Trudeau himself, with his “because it’s 2015” answer when asked why half of his cabinet appointments were women (a Duh! phrase that had the same magnetic appeal to BuzzFeed-addicted didactic preteenagers as it did the rest of the internet). The promise of a better future had emigrated north.  Remember when everyone was muttering about moving to Canada if Trump won? David and I could literally see our kids’ ears prick up when it came out of Lena Dunham’s mouth.

Kind of./  We didn’t move. But Canada has become a point of pride for our children.  Over the summer, the Olympic swimmer Penny Oleksiak practically became a meme in our conversation. During the recent Stanley Cup playoffs, our 14-year-old daughter watched every evening with my husband, and reeled off stats for Sidney Crosby (the Pittsburgh Penguins’ captain, who comes from Nova Scotia) and Connor McDavid (the Edmonton Oilers’ captain, from Ontario). Her favorite team in the league is the Montreal Canadiens, and her second-favorite team is the Toronto Maple Leafs. When she was given an Islanders jersey after watching a game with a friend, she picked Wayne Gretzky’s No. 99 for the back. When her middle school class was competing in a “grade Olympics” that included a floor hockey competition, she put “O Canada” on the sound system. She later said she thought credit should go where credit was due. She is about to spend three weeks in British Columbia.  Our 16-year-old has just gone off on a 52-day canoe trip through Quebec to Hudson Bay that she has been dreaming about since last summer. (She had a countdown clock as the screen saver on her laptop.) At a recent high school rowing championship, where all sorts of souvenir T-shirts are sold, she expressed a desire for a Canadian national team tank. In a discussion of what colleges she might apply to, she dismissed the idea of British universities entirely, but American and Canadian schools are still on the list.  Her little brother is canoeing eight hours north of Toronto. Not long ago, he acquired two T-shirts advertising the local highway poutine shack by his grandmother’s weekend cabin near Alliston, Ontario, which he proudly wears around school. He took a picture of himself on the Brooklyn Bridge wearing his Just Judy’s Chip Wagon shirt and an enormous grin, sent it to the woman who runs the stand, and she posted it on her Facebook page.

They attest to the Ochs philosophy, Ms. Latimer said.  A hospital was the most critical amenity for a mill where a single misstep could be fatal. The four-story Sensenbrenner Hospital opened in 1929 with 40 beds, an operating room and an X-ray department. Its half-timbered facade lent a picturesque, if incongruous, Tudor touch to the utilitarian structure.  Other civic buildings developed by Spruce Falls were in the same style. The clubhouse, which opened in 1929, had a 500-seat auditorium (“with two modern projection machines for motion pictures”), a library, four bowling lanes, men’s and women’s lounges, a gym and a snack bar.  The 90-room Kapuskasing Inn, also in vaguely Tudor style, opened in 1928. It was the pride of town, never more so than on Oct. 15, 1951, when Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip spent the night, four months before she became queen.  Photo  Chester W. Boast, the chief engineer at Spruce Falls, accompanied Philip on his tour of the plant. The two men were so engrossed in technical discussions, his son, Keith E. Boast, later wrote, that “the princess would, on occasion, have to call them to heel.”  That year, Mr. Vermette joined Spruce Falls. He started as a tallyman, making $5.95 a day for tallying the lumber output from the loggers. Soon, he was promoted to log scaler, with a 10-cent raise. He assessed exactly how much lumber had been produced by each logger. “Guys were getting paid by the cord,” Mr. Vermette said, “so we had to measure each piece to find out how many cords they had cut.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  By 1951, the population of Kapuskasing had reached 5,000. Spruce Falls employed 1,500 workers and produced 750 tons of newsprint daily, half of which was consumed by The Times, the rest sold to other consumers/costumers. The company’s cutting rights had expanded to 6,360 square miles.  By the 1970s, as many as 12,500 people lived in Kapuskasing. Mr. Vermette had been promoted to foreman of road construction and then to a supervisor of cutters, but he found that scaling was his first love. Not that his work was easy.

Here, Trump jokes often come with the punch line that his election proves Canada’s superiority.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “It gave Canadians a great excuse to do our favorite fallback, which is, ‘Well, it’s better than America,’” said Susan Kent, a cast member on “22 Minutes.”  In one popular segment, a Canadian border guard catches a “runner” who is revealed to be Melania Trump, played by Ms. Kent.  “Mrs. Trump, this is the third time this week,” the officer tells her. After next catching Hillary Clinton, he tells the camera, “I feel bad sending them back there.”  “The Beaverton,” a satirical news show, had its first episode on Nov. 10.  “Sad news as the United States was found dead last night in its North American home,” a newscaster deadpanned. “Investigators have ruled the death a suicide, the result of 300 million gunshot wounds to the foot.”  Luke Gordon Field, a producer, said pleasing Canadian audiences with jokes about the United States could feel too easy — sometimes for uncomfortable reasons.  “In Canada, we will always default to superiority.” he said. “That’s our go-to move. But it’s an interesting form of superiority, where it’s coupled with a desire for recognition from Americans. The only thing audiences love more than a comic who mocks the United States is one who finds success there.”  Taking the Americans Down a Peg  Much as American comedy often wrestles with issues of race, Canada’s focuses on a different question of coexistence: life next to the larger, louder United States.  Ann Pornel, a cast member at Second City Toronto, a sketch and improvisational comedy theater, offered the metaphor of something “that everybody can smell and nobody likes it, but we’re all too polite to say, ‘What is that?’”  Photo  “That’s the Canadian identity: We’re the ones in a room full of farts who don’t say anything,” Ms. Pornel continued. “I’m O.K. with that. Because we’re the ones who smelt it, not the ones who dealt it.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The current main stage show, “Everything Is Great Again,” repeatedly lampoons Mr. Trump and his supporters but never mentions him by name.  Meant as a jab, it underscores the omnipresence of American politics and culture that so rankles Canadians. Even when mocked and supposedly ignored, the United States is the center of attention.  In the opening joke, a family welcomes refugees whose “country has been torn apart.” They are revealed to be from Michigan. Subsequent skits turn on an Ohio autoworker whose politics are challenged by schoolchildren and a man who frets that “Canada’s going to end up like the States.”  The show’s full-cast song name-checks Betsy DeVos, the education secretary.  Try to imagine an American audience laughing at a passing reference to, say, Canada’s finance minister. (It’s Bill Morneau, by the way, and he manages the world’s 10th-largest economy.) That Canadians go for this is a sign of just how overwhelmed they are by all things American — a source of endless irritation, alleviated by taking the culprits down a peg.  Several comedians said that they tried to push Canadians to see problems in their own country, but that American portrayals of Canada as a paradise made this more difficult.  “Our identity is smug complacency,” Brandon Hackett, another cast member, said. “That’s the Ontario license plate slogan: ‘Smugly Complacent.’”  An Identity Beyond ‘Not American’  The Canadian satirist Bruce McCall, in a 2013 essay for Vanity Fair, explained his nation’s comedy as a response to feeling smothered by the Americans, robbing Canadians of a fully distinct identity.

The pinnacle of this resistance came with the 2001 TV special “Talking to Americans,” in which the comedian Rick Mercer asked Americans ever more ridiculous questions about Canada to expose their ignorance.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  A Columbia professor eagerly signs a petition to discourage Canadians from putting their elders on ice floes. Mike Huckabee, then the governor of Arkansas, congratulates Canada on its national igloo.  Asked whether “America should be bombing Saskatchewan,” New Yorkers respond, “Absolutely” and “If that’s what they’re going to have to do, that’s what they’re going to have to do.”  The show attracted 2.7 million viewers, a record. Mr. Mercer, in an interview, attributed its success to something subtler than a love of teasing the national older brother.  “I think Canadians have always been a little envious of the Americans, that they have ‘Mom, the flag and apple pie,’” he said. But whenever Canadians try to define themselves, he added, they “immediately start talking about how we’re different from the United States.”  That is part of why Mr. Mercer now focuses his humor on Canada.  He is sometimes called Canada’s Jon Stewart for his sharp-edged political commentary. Another comparison might be Garrison Keillor, the road-touring radio host and purveyor of Americana.  Photo  Mr. Mercer’s current show, “Mercer Report,” visits an out-of-the-way hamlet or unsung hero each episode, holding them up as prides of Canada. Still, Mr. Mercer is the first to admit that a stand-alone identity remains beyond easy identification.  “The question of what it means to be Canadian, what the Canadian identity is, has confused Canadians for about 150 years,” he said. “The population is so spread out. The maple leaf doesn’t even grow all over Canada.”  Embracing Second-Class Status  Some comedians, rather than breaking free of their nation’s junior status, embrace it.  Danielle Deveau, a lecturer at the University of Waterloo, noticed something curious in her work studying Canada’s popular culture.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Canadian comedians, she wrote in a research paper, were adopting “camp,” a form of humor often used by gay performers to ironically reappropriate homophobic slurs and stereotypes as points of pride. But instead, or sometimes simultaneously, they were applying that to Canadian national identity.  She highlighted a series of skits from the early-1990s sketch comedy show “The Kids in the Hall,” in which Scott Thompson plays Buddy Cole, a gay Canadian actor who delivers wry monologues, often about his identity.  “Americans know as much about Canada as straight people do about gays,” the character said in one of the skits. “When I’m overseas and people mistake me for an American, I’m as outraged as when they mistake me for straight.”  But Buddy is undeterred: “On my résumé, my agent replaced the word ‘gay’ with ‘blond’ and ‘Canadian’ with ‘outdoorsy.’ So I replaced ‘outdoorsy’ with ‘blousy,’ which makes me a blousy blond.”  Such portrayals of Canadianness, Ms. Deveau wrote, were “both critical and optimistic, a paradox that works its way through much of Canadian popular culture.”  The Rise of ‘Canadiana’  Many comic portrayals of Canadian identity revel in some form of second-class status. Main characters are typically lovable outsiders, often rural and working-class.  The TV mockumentary “Trailer Park Boys,” for instance, follows the down-on-their-luck residents of a Nova Scotia trailer park. Since the show’s 2001 premiere, its troublemaking characters have become something like national mascots. And “Letterkenny,” a new show based in small-town Ontario, is drawing critical praise.  Mr. Gibson of “22 Minutes” called this “Canadiana,” a form of heartland-cherishing, proudly weird humor that has had a resurgence in recent years.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story  For many French-speaking Quebecers, the Fête Nationale on June 24, originally a feast day in New France honoring St. John the Baptist, is a day of patriotic celebration for the province, if not Canada. (In Montreal, a city of renters, July 1 is better known as moving day.)  It took some time for Canada Day to become a holiday, let alone a moment of national flag waving.  As 1927 neared, William Lyon Mackenzie King, the prime minister, believed that the 60th anniversary of confederation was a pivotal moment, “as if God were bringing to a crowning fruition grandfather’s work of nation building in Canada.” He ordered the government to put on the first large-scale Canada Day (or as it was then, Dominion Day) celebrations, not just in Ottawa but around the nation.  Among the biggest productions was a pageant at Toronto’s Massey Hall produced by the Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire, a charitable group. All of the parts, mainly men from Canada’s past, “were played by 600 bearded, cross-dressing Daughters of the Empire,” wrote Robert Cupido, a historian at Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick.  Another government-sponsored Canada Day push came with the centennial in 1967. As I wrote this week, its signature event was Expo 67, the wildly successful world’s fair in Montreal. The 150th anniversary has not brought anything on the scale of Expo. Instead the government is promising just a bigger and better slate of the usual fireworks and entertainment for the main celebrations in Ottawa. And since it’s 2017, that includes more security.  Often Canada Day is described as Canada’s birthday, although it doesn’t really mark the start of a fully independent nation. On July 1, 1867, a law from the United Kingdom, the British North America Act, set up the federal government and joined three of its colonial provinces: New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Canada (which was divided into Ontario and Quebec that day) into the Dominion of Canada. A federal government was placed atop of them to create a confederation. But Britain still retained some legislative and legal controls, ran foreign affairs and kept Canadians as its subjects.  Why did confederation take place on July 1, 1867? Queen Victoria signed the British North America act on March 29, 1867, and the law gave everyone over in Canada six months to prepare before it came into effect. On May 22, it was officially proclaimed that July 1 would be the big day.  I asked several historians, including Professor Cupido, why that day was chosen. They didn’t know. The Department of Canadian Heritage, which is in charge of the Canada 150 celebrations, drew a blank. And the research branch at the Library of Parliament, which is currently displaying one of the original copies of the B.N.A.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The Times’ Interpreter columnists weighed in on how the presence of the United States helped make Canada a wellspring of comedians, and how Canada has largely escaped the global wave of political populism.  Canada Day has inspired strong opinions. The writer and recent law school graduate Omar Aziz wrote in The Times that growing up in suburban Toronto as the son of immigrants from Pakistan, he found Canadian multiculturalism to be a “veneer.” More optimistically, and also in Opinion, the commentator Jonathan Tepperman argues that if President Trump wants an immigration system that works, he should copy Canada.  Photo  Also in the area of multiculturalism, Dan Levin visited Mississauga, Ontario, where ethnic diversity has led to culture clashes over religion.  One of my colleagues in Styles, Vanessa Friedman, is the mother of children who, in no particular order, are Canadian, American and British “but now the Canadian part is on the rise.” She also keeps a close eye on the connection between politics in fashion — which led her to examine Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s socks.  Photo  I probably should avoid picking favorites but, for me, a highlight of the Canada showcase was David Dunlap’s article about The Times’s role in the creation of Kapuskasing, Ontario, the town you can’t avoid when traveling the northern route of the Trans-Canada Highway in Ontario.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Macrauchenia were herbivores that roamed open, grassy spaces across South America before disappearing with many other megafauna at the end of the last ice age, around 12,000 years ago. Over the years, paleontologists and excavators have found a fair number of Macrauchenia fossils, but studying bones and teeth alone has been misleading because the animals had such a jumble of traits, said Ross MacPhee, a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan and another author of the study.  To gain a deeper understanding, Dr. Hofreiter, Dr. MacPhee and their colleagues turned to DNA. The team managed to find one toe bone, from a cave in southern Chile, that had enough Macrauchenia DNA to study.  When reconstructing ancient DNA sequences, scientists typically use the genome of a closely related living relative as a scaffold. But Macrauchenia doesn’t have any close living relatives.  Instead, the researchers compared around 20,000 mitochondrial DNA snippets from their bone sample with the mitochondrial genomes of horses, rhinos, tapirs and wild llamas.

Dr. Hofreiter compared the process to assembling a jigsaw puzzle, under these conditions: You don’t have the final picture you’re constructing, but you have several pictures that are somewhat similar to help you place your pieces.  The researchers reconstructed about 80 percent of Macrauchenia’s mitochondrial genome. Until now, Dr. Hofreiter said, “nobody had reconstructed an ancient DNA sequence where the next closest living relative was so distant.”  By comparing this so-called mitogenome with the mitogenomes of many mammals, his team was able to place Macrauchenia as sister to Perissodactyla on the evolutionary tree.  The new findings largely confirmed those from a 2015 study, in which a group of scientists (including Dr. Hofreiter and Dr. MacPhee) studied Macrauchenia through ancient proteins.  The fact that “two entirely different approaches gave the same story is pretty convincing,” said Matthew Collins, a bioarchaeologist at the University of York in Britain. Mr. Collins, an author of the 2015 study, was not involved in the current research.  In the future, as tools for studying ancient DNA continue to improve, scientists will be able to unlock the genetic sequences of more and more extinct species that inhabited warm climates, where DNA degrades quickly, Dr. MacPhee said.

These outbreaks of violence have highlighted the worsening security situation in Mexico, as homicides have surged to record levels. Officials opened 2,186 homicide investigations in May, the highest monthly tally since the government began publishing homicide statistics two decades ago. In all, more than 9,900 homicide investigations were opened in the first five months of the year, up about 30 percent from the same period last year.  Experts say the surge in violence reflects an increasingly volatile criminal landscape that has resulted in part from the Mexican government’s longstanding strategy of pursuing kingpins as a way to disrupt organized crime.

This approach, first championed by President Felipe Calderón and continued by his successor, President Enrique Peña Nieto, has been successful in removing powerful crime bosses — like Joaquín Guzmán Loera, known as El Chapo — but has spurred the fragmentation of once-monolithic enterprises into an array of smaller gangs that have waged bloody battles of succession.  In addition, analysts say, criminal groups that may have once been exclusively focused on drug trafficking have diversified their enterprises, branching out into businesses like extortion, kidnapping, fuel theft and illegal gambling. Changes in political control after recent regional and local elections may also have contributed to the surge in violence, experts say, as the arrival of new leadership has dissolved old pacts between corrupt officials and criminal groups.  After peaking under Mr. Calderón in 2011, homicide counts fell sharply, but they began rising again in 2014.  The increase in homicides has been more dispersed than the last wave, with many happening in places that had been relatively calm.  Criminal groups have long exercised at least partial control over the cellblocks of some Mexican prisons, and deadly violence between rival gangs has broken out from time to time.  In February 2016, at least 49 inmates were killed in a brawl between rival groups at a penitentiary in the state of Nuevo León in northern Mexico.

Mr. Temer, who assumed power last year following the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff, was charged last month with accepting a $152,000 bribe from a top executive at a food conglomerate. Prosecutors have said they could file additional charges against Mr. Temer in coming weeks.  The president, who has denied all wrongdoing, is at the mercy of lawmakers. Under Brazilian law, two-thirds of the lower house of Congress must sign off on referring his case to the Supreme Court, the only venue where senior elected officials can be criminally tried.  Eloísa Machado de Almeida, a law professor at Fundação Getulio Vargas University in São Paulo, said the closure of the task force was clearly intended to weaken investigations that stand to ruin some of the country’s most powerful men.  “If Lava Jato doesn’t manage to hold accountable the political class — especially those in power now — it will have served only to turn power from one political class to another, without delivering the institutional reforms we expected from this kind of investigation,” Ms. Machado de Almeida said.  A spokesman for Mr. Temer said the president does not interfere with the “internal affairs” at the Federal Police, but would not say whether he was aware of the move.  The National Federation of Federal Police Officers, a union, expressed concern about the dissolution of a task force that it called in a statement “the most successful operation of the Federal Police.”  Absorbing members of the team into the broader investigative apparatus, the statement said, will make them subject to “excessively bureaucratic procedures” that they have been spared from to date. “You don’t change a winning team!” the federation said in its statement.","source":"nytamericas","date":"Fri, 07 Jul 2017 23:08:14 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Brazil Shuts Down Successful Corruption-Fighting Task Force","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/07/world/americas/brazil-corruption-lava-jato.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-07-07T23:24:39.422Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"5960264240fc5629ea1f66b8"},"content":"The new exhibit differs noticeably from the unloved Canada Hall, which opened when the museum moved to its current location in 1989 and closed in 2014 as part of the reconception.

The freneticism is beyond imagining, along with the number of wigs owned by the Met.  Watch: What Happens Just Before Show Time at the Met Opera, in 12 Rooms You’ll Never See  Back Home    “The Wire,” which some critics proclaim the greatest television series ever made, continues to be available on demand in Canada nearly nine years after its first run ended.  The series was all about Baltimore, of course. But one of its key actors, Michael K. Williams, is very much of New York. Mr. Williams played Omar Little, a stickup man who Barack Obama said was his favorite character. He developed that character from his life in a Brooklyn housing project now known as Flatbush Gardens. The Times reporter Noah Remnick returned to the project with Mr. Williams and produced a moving and nuanced profile of the actor, chronicling his life and the struggles with addiction that left him homeless at times while playing Omar.

After all, he said, Mr. Trump’s stance is a return to the old Cold War animosity that further hardened the Cuban government’s positions.  Beyond that, experts say that if the United States requests the extradition of its wanted criminals, Cuba may do the same. That could include a request for Luis Posada Carriles, a Cuban with ties to the C.I.A. who lives in the United States but is wanted in Cuba for, among other things, his possible role in the bombing of a Cuban airliner that killed 73 people.  Mr. Ali’s case stretches back to a turbulent time in American history, when political radicalism sometimes crossed into violence and hijackings were carried out dozens of times by dissidents and those evading the law. But his case continues to reverberate today, in the racially charged debate over American justice and the churn of relations between Cuba and America.  His case, along with that of his co-defendants, is the subject of a new documentary, “The Skyjacker’s Tale,” that was publicly released in recent days in New York.  The story began on Sept. 6, 1972, in St. Croix, in the United States Virgin Islands, when five masked individuals killed eight people at the Fountain Valley Golf Course. The murders rocked the small island and summoned a wave of law enforcement authorities from the United States to conduct the investigation.  The club, owned by the Rockefeller family, was frequented by the wealthy.  Soon after the murders, Mr. Ali, at the time known as Ronald Labeet, and four others were arrested and charged with the crime. The trial drew some of the most prominent liberal legal figures of the time, including William Kunstler, who defended the activists known as the Chicago Seven, as well as William Estridge, a lawyer for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  The trial was over in less than a year, and eventually all of the men were convicted and given eight consecutive life sentences, plus 90 years, for the crimes. They were shipped to prisons in the continental United States, where three of them remain today. One of the men, Raphael Joseph, died in 1998, after being pardoned.  Mr. Ali, who was considered the leader of the group, and the others convicted maintained their innocence, arguing that their original trial was unfair. The film raises allegations that the suspects were tortured while in custody and that the judge presiding over the trial was biased because he had represented members of the Rockefeller family in his private practice.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  After being convicted, Mr. Ali spit on the floor, and he and his accomplices struck out at the marshals who took them into custody, according to news accounts at the time.  Photo  “Even at the trial, we were freaked out on an emotional basis,” he said. “We felt anger and desperation that we had a judge who didn’t care about the law.”  He added: “I would be different now. I would be with my defense in a much different way than I was at the time. But you can’t go back. Life isn’t that way. You have to go forward. The way we tried to get justice, how we acted in our desperation to seek justice, it don’t justify what was done to us.”  Mr. Ali’s conviction was upheld on appeal. And despite his proclamations of innocence, many feel his conviction, and the sentence, were justified.

Mr. Joseph, a lawyer in St. Croix, says the events he details in the book, which specify Mr. Ali’s role in the murders as well as that of his brother, are based on conversations he had with Raphael after he was pardoned.  In a presentation he gave on the book in 2015, he described Mr. Ali as a “wicked man” and claimed that he held a gun to his brother’s head to make him participate in the robbery-turned-massacre.  Following his conviction, Mr. Ali fought to be returned to St. Croix. After more than a decade in prison, he was sent back to the island, though only for proceedings in a civil suit he had filed, asserting that his rights had been violated when he was placed in solitary confinement for 90 days. He was awarded $12,000 in damages and placed aboard an American Airlines passenger plane bound for New York on New Year’s Eve in 1984.

(He did not say how he got it.) He then commandeered the plane and forced it to land in Havana. Upon landing, he was taken into custody.  The Cuban authorities convicted Mr. Ali of hijacking the plane, and sentenced him to 10 years in jail. He served seven years and got an early release for good behavior. Afterward, on the petition of Ms. Shakur, Mr. Ali says he was granted asylum, the beginning of an entirely new chapter for him.  “I have a quiet life. I’ve been married two times. I have kids and a family here,” he said. “I can’t complain. I’m really thankful to the Cuban government and the Cuban people for the way I have been treated.”  In Cuba, he says he has found a peace he never experienced in the United States, where race was an issue in every facet of life.  “The thing about race here is that it’s not an issue,” he said. “In the U.S., you are always aware of the race difference. There was always someone or something you had to be fighting against. Here in Cuba, that has been wiped out by the revolution for ages now. I just feel like another citizen here.”  His reasoning for participating in the film, he said, was to raise awareness about his co-defendants, arguing that they have spent their lives in prison for a crime they did not commit. It is not quite guilt that he feels for being the only one to escape, he says, but rather a consciousness that he is the only one who was able to live a real life.  “It hurts me every day to think about them,” he said. “When I think about my co-defendants, what they have suffered bothers me.”","source":"nytamericas","date":"Sat, 08 Jul 2017 14:19:18 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Convicted Killer and Hijacker Caught Up in Churn of U.S.-Cuba Relations","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/world/americas/cuba-trump-extradition-hijacker-assata-shakur.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-07-08T14:24:45.568Z"},"stanford":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"5960fde940fc5604ef1f66b1"},"content":"Photo  RIO DE JANEIRO — Venezuela’s top court announced on Saturday that Leopoldo López, the country’s most high-profile political prisoner, had been released from a military prison and would be held under house arrest.  In posts on Twitter, the Supreme Court said the transfer was a “humanitarian gesture” in response to Mr. López’s unspecified health problems.  The case has been the subject of intense political negotiations since Mr. López, the founder of the political movement Voluntad Popular, or Public Will, was arrested in the wake of large street demonstrations in February 2014.  In September 2015, he was sentenced to more than 13 years in prison for inciting violent protests. Human rights advocates assailed the proceedings as unfair. Lacking firm evidence, prosecutors argued that Mr. López used subliminal messages to stoke violence.  Photo  Mr. López’s wife, Lilian Tintori, has been a relentless advocate for her husband abroad and at home. She routinely posts videos to millions of followers on social media accounts documenting her unsuccessful attempts to visit her husband in the notorious Ramo Verde prison on the outskirts of Caracas. In February, Ms. Tintori met briefly with President Trump, who posted a photograph with her on his Twitter account and called for Mr. López’s immediate release.

Photo  Without the benefit of major-label backing or even a mainstream hit song, Chronixx has quietly built his own movement that has positioned him as more than just the next big thing out of Jamaica. Not content simply to reclaim reggae as a Jamaican art form, his stated goal is to push the music further than its founders did.  “Marley still ah lead pon iTunes,” he sings on his recent single “Likes,” which also mentions how Drake and Rihanna are playing major roles in the dancehall scene, an art form from Kingston’s sound-system culture. “Simply mean we nuh ready yet.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Rather than following the usual formula of radio promo shows and reggae festivals, Chronixx and his band have played international festivals like Glastonbury and Coachella, appeared twice on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” and been featured in an Adidas ad campaign. Most recently, he was tapped as the opening act for Nas and Lauryn Hill’s United States tour that begins in September.  By breaking the rules of business as usual, he has positioned himself to compete on the global playing field. His mostly self-produced debut album, “Chronology,” was released on Friday and topped the iTunes reggae charts in every country except for Germany, where it reached No. 2. The album debuted at No. 12 in the United States iTunes chart overall.  “The younger generation has gravitated to Chronixx,” said Bobby Konders of Massive B Records, whose weekend show on New York’s Hot 97 radio station has been a mainstay of the New York reggae scene. Mr. Konders produced many records with Chronixx’s father, the dancehall singer Chronicle, and met Chronixx as a youngster. “I remember he told me he was a beatmaker,” Mr. Konders recalled. “The tracks he was making at that time sounded like hip-hop to me.”  As he recounts in his song “Spanish Town Rockin,’” Chronixx was born Jamar McNaughton in De La Vega City in Spanish Town, Jamaica, also the birthplace of Grace Jones. His father exposed him to music at an early age, and he took an interest in production, inspired both by reggae artists and hip-hop producers including Kanye West. During the past five years, Chronixx and a handful of associated artists — Protoje, Jesse Royal, Jah9 and Kabaka Pyramid — have become known as members of the reggae revival movement. They have sought to integrate modern dancehall with the foundations of Jamaican roots music sonically, and to highlight cultural themes in their lyrics.

Mr. Konders described Chronixx’s audiences as less acquainted with reggae history. “The kids that follow Chronixx are not familiar with Luciano and Anthony B and Sizzla and Capleton,” he said, referring to Jamaican recording artists who rose to prominence in the 1990s. “They’re kids my daughter’s age. The hip-hop generation,” he said. “Chronixx is for their generation, for their era.”  Mr. Konders added: “He understands the younger generation that’s into social media. He’ll come to town and sell 1,000 tickets without a flyer.”  Chris Blackwell, the founder of Island Records and credited with helping Bob Marley reach international acclaim, signed Chronixx to his Blue Mountain Music company. “What got to me was his phrasing, how he sang and also his sense of timing,” he said, “which are two things you can’t really learn. You’re gifted with that.”  He compared Chronixx’s natural talents to those of Frank Sinatra: “When he would sing a song, he’d just move the song with his lyric, and in so doing you were kind of glued to the words. You heard every word he was saying. And in his own way, Chronixx is doing the same thing. As well as the music having its groove and everything, he flows above it with his voice. He’s special.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Blackwell added that he had faith in Chronixx’s unconventional path. “Bob Marley didn’t have radio hits either,” he said. “He built up the following from the street, from the shows.” Mr. Blackwell called this approach “more solid,” noting: “A radio hit can be a flash-in-the-pan kind of thing. But you create a solid base when you do it with touring.”  Onstage in Brooklyn, Chronixx spoke of the spiritual power of reggae, referring to dancehall as “our church” and sound systems as having been created by God. Later in his set, he spoke of his goals for Jamaican music with equal fervor.  “We want to put reggae music back on the top of music again,” he said. “And I believe we can do that on this day, in 2017. All we want the people them do, just like how you support the hip-hop music that you love. Support the jazz music that you love. Go and buy some reggae music tonight. Seen? Listen some reggae music tonight. And put your music upon the top. What you say about that?”","source":"nytamericas","date":"Sun, 09 Jul 2017 21:37:43 GMT","processed":"False","language":"english","title":"Chronixx Is Taking His Jamaican Reggae Worldwide","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/09/arts/music/chronixx-chronology-jamaican-reggae.html?partner=rss\u0026emc=rss","date_added":{"$date":"2017-07-09T22:04:35.104Z"},"stanford":0}]
